    <h1>Algorithm Awareness & The Spread of Conspiracy Theories</h1>
    <h2>The Basics of Recommendation Algorithms</h2>
    <p class="margin"> A recommendation algorithm is an AI algorithm that is used to suggest or recommend products, services, posts, or any desired content to a consumer based on information collected about the consumer. Due to their effectiveness they are utilized almost everywhere on the internet from social media to shopping sites, so that these sites can get the most consumer attention possible. For instance you might have Amazon recommend you some items based on what you’ve been searching and looking at on Amazon. On social media sites the data collection is often even more extensive leading to the posts or videos being recommended on TikTok or Instagram based on the smallest behaviors like what posts you liked, watch time, or location.

    <h2>The Feedback Loop</h2>
        <p class="margin"> One of the main ways recommendation algorithms are so effective is through feedback loops. First it uses its current model to make some recommendations for the user. Then the user gives feedback on those recommendations, through viewing or liking the content, which the recommendation algorithm uses to improve its recommendations. The user then gets better recommendations and the process repeats leading to recommendations becoming even more narrow and specific to the user. This leads to the user being stuck in an echo chamber where they only get content that becomes increasingly catered to them, and while this may be great for streaming services or shopping sites, it can begin to become problematic when used in social media.

	<h2>Conspiracy Theories & Algorithmic Amplification</h2>
	<p class="margin"> Echo chambers can be very harmful in social media as they can limit the information one receives. Due to the popularity garnered by conspiracy theories they are often recommended to social media users, and when users become hooked onto the theory they get more content about said theory due to the algorithm trying to find more of what that user likes. This leads to users becoming stuck in a loop of receiving more and more false information, as they become more engaged in sensational conspiracy theory content, and more content of that nature is provided to them.
    </p>
    
	<h2>Platform Incentives</h2>
	<p class="margin"> Despite the harm of recommendation algorithms on the information we receive, they are still widely used in practically all social media, often completely unrestricted. This is because these algorithms are highly effective at keeping users engaged and producing more ad revenue for the platform so content providers have no incentive to cut back on usage of recommendation algorithms. The fact of the matter is that without recommendation algorithms social media would be nowhere near engaging as it is, and for that reason they won’t be going anywhere anytime soon.
    </p>

    <h2>Potential for Exploitation</h2>
    <p class="margin"> Content creators are often aware of the nature of recommendation algorithms and often use certain tactics so that the algorithm favors their content. They may use provocative thumbnails or titles to try to gain clicks or make content that aligns with trends. The content doesn’t even need to be something that the user likes, as long as it's something that gets the user attention, the user will engage with it more, leading to the algorithm to produce more content that gets the user’s attention. When this content contains misinformation it can lead to people becoming highly misinformed or becoming strongly opinionated on controversial topics. This is why in our day and age conspiracy theories have become so widespread, due to it being so easy to spread misinformation.
