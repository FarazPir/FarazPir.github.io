  <h1> Faraz Piracha's Portfolio </h1>
  <p> This is a Digital Portfolio I've created to show my past accomplishments as well as give basic info about myself. By creating this page I hope to exhibit my growth as a student to those who want to see what skills and experiences I have to offer. </p>
  <h2> Who am I? </h2>
  <div class="uncenter margin">
    <p> My name is Faraz Piracha. At the moment I am 17 years old and a Senior at Allen High School. I’ve lived here in Allen, Texas with my family for my entire life. My friends would describe me as kind and helpful and I always try my best to be helpful to people around me.
    </p>
    <p> I’m planning on pursuing a computer programming related career. I’m currently in my third year of Computer Science at Allen High School, and I took Fundamentals of Computer Science prior to my first year, so by the end of this year I would have completed four years of computer science classes. I’m planning on pursuing a Computer Science major in college. Other classes I’m taking at the moment include Statistics, Physics, English, and Government, but I've also completed Calculus and Spanish in prior years. I’m in the PB&Joy club where we make sandwiches for the needy and the Plarning club where we use plastic bags to make sleeping bags for the homeless. I’m also the secretary for the Computer Science Club so I do various duties such as managing the finances to keep the club running. 
    </p>
    <p> My hobbies mainly consist of playing video games, reading, comics, and watching TV and movies. My time is often spent at home, but I try to get out of the house whenever I can. I’m always open to trying new things, and I enjoy hanging out with my friends and family. I also regularly help with duties at my mosque such as cleaning and helping manage activities. 
    </p>
    <p> My aspirations are to go to a 4 year college/university and then pursue a career of my choice. In the meantime, I’m just trying to do well in all of my classes and I want to try to get a part time job. I hope to meet lots of new people and make new friends along the way. I always strive for success not only for myself but for those around me as well. 
      </p>

  <h2> Why Make a Portfolio?</h2>
  <div class="uncenter margin">
    <p> A digital portfolio allows me to put all my skills, achievements, and relevant details in one place. This makes it convenient for anyone who needs these details for certain purposes as well as just people who are curious about who I am. Since it is digital it is easy for me to make changes to it, and all these changes will occur in real-time allowing for me to be able to constantly keep my portfolio up to date. My portfolio contains all of my relevant experince and skills, allowing anyone to know exaclty what I'm capable of and what I've done. I can send it to anyone who wants to know what I'm capable of, making it easy for employers, educators, and others to determine whether I'm qualified for their tasks or not. It not only serves as a convenience but also helps me put myself out there by making my info more widely available. It ultimately helps ensure my success in my career and other important matters. </p>
