                            <p> This week we faced a lot of scheduling challenges due to our new missions and AP exams.
                                It was difficult to find time to work on ISP this week since all of our in class time
                                was spent on the missions while most of our at-home time was spent studying for our AP
                                exams. I managed to get some work done, but not a whole lot, and from what I can tell
                                most of our group also got small amounts of work done. With our presentation having the
                                possibility of being as early as Wednesday, we will have to have the majority of our ISP
                                completed over the weekend. I think this is doable since the majority of the ISP is done
                                with just some final things that need to be done.

                            <p> This week I faced some scheduling challenges. While I had finished the planning stage of
                                the week without any issues, when it came to the execution phase of the week some
                                problems arose. I was able to start my revamp of the matching game, but I did not make
                                as much progress on it as I would have liked. I am planning to make up for this by
                                finishing it up over the weekend. While I think I could have gotten more work done on it
                                if I managed my at-home time a bit better, one thing that caught me off guard was the
                                introduction of a new merlin assignment. Working on this merlin assignment took time
                                away from the ISP so it made it harder to find time to work on my ISP. However I don’t
                                want to blame this assignment as the sole reason for my problems, I think it was my own
                                scheduling practices combined with this that led to me not accomplishing enough.
                                Hopefully in the last week of the ISP I can pick up the pace and get everything done. I
                                worry this will be difficult with the approaching deadline and the need to study for my
                                upcoming AP exams.

                            <p> This week while I did accomplish my goals I was hoping to get a little more done. I had
                                originally hoped to get some code done on a new or preexisting game, but that did not
                                happen. However since my goals didn’t require any coding and mainly involved just
                                planning I was still able to accomplish my goals. I think this week was overall fine
                                since the planning I got done was important, but I need to do some actual coding next
                                week.

                            <p> This week we didn’t face any challenges, everything went smoothly without any major
                                problems. I was able to complete my word scramble game, copy it, and then push it
                                without any issues. The rest of the team also didn’t face any major issues to my
                                knowledge.

                            <p> Our team’s progress continued well as usual. I finished the word scramble game and
                                development continued smoothly on everything else. I think at this point we definitely
                                have enough features, now we’re just adding more stuff and polishing it.

                            <h3> Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
                            <p> This week we made a huge breakthrough with one of our long running interpersonal
                                challenges. I finally got in touch with our member in another class and got him to work
                                on something meaningful to the project. I caught him up to speed with the state of the
                                progress and explained the process of developing a game as well as sources to use to
                                create the game. The game he is working on isn’t necessary for the project, so if he
                                doesn’t get it done there’s no harm. I think from this point forward our collaboration
                                will be much better, and I hope this member’s contributions can be meaningful to the
                                project.

                            <p> This week we didn’t face any technical challenges since at this point we knew what we
                                were doing in JavaScript and with branch merging. We have a pretty good understanding of
                                what we need to do and how to do it, so I think from here on we will have few technical
                                challenges. One decision I had to make this week was to shift from working on a tangram
                                game, to a word scramble game since I was unable to find a tutorial for the tangram
                                game, but it was very easy to find one for the word scramble game.
                            </p>

                            <p> Our team continued to progress well this week, the development of the website and the
                                games continued smoothly. I had also started to get some work done myself on making a
                                new game. I spent the first part of the week initially trying to find an easy way to
                                make a tangram game, before making the decision to make a word scramble game instead. I
                                then started working on it over the weekend. I think most of the team was pretty
                                productive this week.

                            <p> At this stage most parts of the ISP are worked on independently. Each game is developed
                                by a different person, and other aspects such as the help-tree and the web-design are
                                also assigned to different individuals. I think the fact that we have so much
                                independence is great, and I think it will make the project go by a lot faster. My only
                                worry is that forgetting to communicate things could cause some issues, but if it does I
                                think the consequences will probably be pretty minor.

                            <p> We didn’t face many technical issues this week. The design for our website moved along
                                nicely and the website looks great in its current state. There were some challenges in
                                getting things to look right on all screen sizes, but I think we will fix that later on.
                                Overall I’d say everything went smoothly with technology.

                                progress we made on the design. Unfortunately I haven’t gotten too much done since I
                                made the matching game. It’s been difficult to find time to get stuff done, but I know I
                                need to make some progress so I don’t drag down the team. This weekend I will try to get
                                work done on a new game, and hopefully myself and my teammates can continue to get lots
                                of work done as the project continues.

                            <p> Our team is still having great collaboration. We were able to talk about designs for the
                                website, and do other communications with the team. The team works mostly independently
                                so we don’t have that much working together on things nowadays, but thanks to Discord we
                                usually have some idea of what progress is being made. I still feel like there could be
                                more communication since I don’t know everything that’s happening with the project a lot
                                of the time, but that shouldn’t be an issue since we know everything that we need to
                                know for our work to get done. However the issue of our member in another class still
                                persists, and I’m not sure how they can be incorporated into our project in a meaningful

                            <p> This week while I did not do anything significant the rest of my group made a lot of
                                progress. One of my members got a lot of the website’s design done and another member
                                got all of our various pages linked together. We faced no challenges as everything moved
                                smoothly.

                                Most of the group worked at a steady pace, but I haven’t really done anything
                                significant since the break. I have plans to create a tangram game, and I did some
                                research into it, but I haven’t found a good tutorial for it. I think unlike the
                                matching game where I had tutorials, I will have to come up with most of the tangram
                                code myself which could be very time consuming. Hopefully I can have this game and one
                                more game done before the project is due.

                                order. Other team members also got some progress done, such as creating a blob for the
                                website's aesthetic, and doing research into other ways to make the website more
                                professional. Overall we didn’t face any real technical challenges this week and

                                steady pace. While we didn’t face any real scheduling challenges this week I worry if we
                                can keep up the pace in the coming weeks.

                                team. However, the issue of our team members in another class not being able to
                                contribute as much still continued, and addition we couldn’t figure out a way for them
                                to contribute to the project. Hopefully they will be able to play a more active role in

                            <p> This week a prototype of the matching game was completed. Although I had learned the
                                basics of JavaScript, I was still largely unfamiliar with the language so understanding
                                the code was a bit of a challenge at times. Finding good images without copyright
                                problems took time, and then afterwards the images needed to be cropped and all brought
                                to the same size. Since I had created my own directory for testing JavaScript code,
                                running and testing the code was not much of a challenge. Eventually the game was
                                completed and all bugs were fixed, but doing the whole thing in one week took more work
                                than I expected.

                                This week was spring break and it was our group’s time to get the work done that we had
                                not been doing the previous weeks. I’d say I accomplished everything I wanted to during
                                this week at a reasonable pace, however if our group had gotten more work done
                                beforehand working over the break wouldn’t be necessary. However not many members worked
                                over the break, but it's possible some progress was made outside the github repository
                                that I wasn’t aware of.

                                to reach out when we needed to. Since we were all working independently, we weren’t
                                aware of what progress was being made at the moment, but it didn’t matter since we all
                                had different portions of the project that didn’t overlap.

                            <p> This week we managed to achieve some technical accomplishments. I started to learn the
                                basics of JavaScript and other team members made some progress on their work as well.
                                Learning JavaScript didn’t present many challenges, although I worry that just knowing
                                the basics won’t be enough to get through making the games. It was similar to other
                                languages I know so I think I’ll get the hang of it quickly. Also now that we’ve got the
                                hang of merges our collaboration on GitHub will be much better now.

                            <p> I’m glad that the team has started making some progress. I think as long as we don’t get
                                lazy this progress will continue. Our team seems to also all be familiar with Discord
                                now, so communication with the team will be a lot smoother now. I still worry that we
                                won’t keep up the pace, but only time will tell. However, having assigned tasks should
                                make scheduling go a lot smoother.

                                idea what everyone is up to. We also are able to contact our Release Engineer whenever
                                we get commits done, so getting things merged should be easy. Overall I think we’re

                            <p> This week we didn’t face any technical challenges since we didn’t really do much on the
                                ISP this week, as we were busy with our in class assignments. We had to add a
                                license.txt file this week, but that was very simple and easy.

                                get done and how to do it, now we just needed to get the work done. While we didn’t
                                accomplish any work yet, I think since we now know what to do we will be getting lots of
                                work done on the ISP in the coming weeks.

                            <p> Since we didn’t do any ISP stuff this week aside from adding the license.txt, we didn’t
                                really do any collaborative work. I think we will be seeing more independent work from
                                here on now that everyone’s role has been established. I think a lot of the project's
                                success relies on each team member’s independence, but we may still need to collaborate
                                at times.

                            <p> We faced many technical challenges this week as we were trying to complete our first
                                progress check. We faced challenges when it came to merges, as for a while we weren’t
                                sure what the progress check meant by three merges, and once we figured out what it
                                meant we didn’t know how to do it. After some research we figured it out, and then we
                                decided to implement it by splitting up the various departments and features in
                                different branches which would all be merged back to the main branch. Getting the merges
                                to work properly took some time and we ran into some problems, but eventually we managed
                                to get it to work.
                            </p>

                            <p> While we did make a lot of progress this week, it was mostly due to the progress check
                                compelling us to do so. Additionally since we were busy learning L-Systems, we held off
                                the progress check all the way till Thursday, so most of us had to do all of our commits
                                and issue interactions in the last two days of the week. We also had to figure out how
                                merges worked so it put a lot of pressure on us in the last two days. I think this week
                                definitely serves as a lesson to get a head start on the weekly progress checks.

                                successfully collaborated on the presentation and the advertisement, and our end product
                                for both of them was great. We also managed to use Discord to keep our member in a
                                different class in the loop, which was a great improvement from prior weeks. Despite us
                                having to crunch most of the work at the end of the week, we were able to do a call on
                                Discord and get everything sorted out. We continued to communicate on Discord as we got
                                our work done and kept each other in the loop. By working together and planning things
                                out we were able to get a lot of work done at the end of the week despite the lack of
                                time we had, and we all were able to contribute something. So far this has been one of
                                the best weeks for collaboration.

                                out issues as seen with presentation, but still very little has been started on the ISP.
                                We’re still not too far into the semester so I think we’ll eventually start to pick up
                                the pace, but at the moment we still got ways to go.

                            <p> Our team continued to work well together and we had both communication in person and
                                through Discord. There was still the issue of our teammate in another class, but we are
                                able to reach out to them when we need to, although that doesn’t happen much. In the
                                future we should probably assign that member a certain task they can do on their own, so
                                that they can contribute to the team as much as everyone else is.

                            <p> No technical challenges I was aware of, not due to not getting anything done this time,
                                rather it was instead due to school being canceled for most of the week due to icy
                                roads. We didn’t communicate a lot over this time so I’m unsure what problems other team
                                members encountered.
                            </p>

                            <p> This break gave us a lot of time to get work done. Since we didn’t communicate too much
                                over break I don’t know how much was done, but from the conversations I’ve had with
                                other members it's clear some JavaScript learning was done. A member also sent a message
                                out to all members to start coding in JavaScript so more of us probably got started on
                                that. Overall due to being out the whole week I’m not sure what exactly was done, but
                                I’m under the impression members did get work done as there was some new activity on the
                                GitHub.

                            <p> Our group being unable to communicate in person was a huge challenge as no one knew what
                                each other was working on at home. We were able to communicate on Discord when
                                necessary, but a situation never arose where we needed to, aside from sending a message
                                to get started on JavaScript.

                            <p> We still didn’t face any technical issues due to the lack of anything technical being
                                done. Game team still hadn’t started and the chatbot team continued to chart out and
                                plan the workings of the chatbot.

                            <p> Still suffering from the same challenges from last week, which have only been compounded
                                by an upcoming SQL quiz we need to study for. Despite this we’re not worried at all
                                since we’re only a couple weeks into the semester and we still have plenty of time to
                                get started. The question is if we will start to pick up the pace soon enough, or remain
                                not doing much. However the chatbot team didn’t suffer from as many of these problems as
                                they had gotten some more work done.

                                and game team operated mostly independently so not everyone was fully informed of what
                                work had already been done, but everyone knew what was necessary to their job so it
                                didn’t matter. There was still the problem of communication with our member in another
                                class.

                            <p> We did not face many technical challenges this week as no technical work had really been
                                done yet. At the moment our team is split into halves, with one half focusing more on
                                the chatbot and the other half focusing more on the games. The chatbot half got some
                                work done planning out the chatbot, while the game half did not start yet, mostly due to
                                needing to focus on learning SQL and not knowing JavaScript yet.

                            <p> We did face some scheduling challenges as the game half had not started any work at all,
                                mostly because we were preoccupied with SQL stuff. I do not believe the chatbot half had
                                these problems as they seemed to be productive with their work. The game half still
                                needs to get started by learning JavaScript, so getting started could be a challenge.

                                of our members was unable to fully participate in collaboration due to being in a
                                different class. In the future we need to make sure to stay in touch with that member so
                                they’re in the loop on what’s happening.

                            <p> This week we did not face too many technical issues as we did not start the actual code
                                yet and only worked on the setting up the GitHub Repository and Project Page. Getting
                                the hang of using issues in GitHub took some time and there was some confusion in the
                                beginning. There were also issues we ran into with git push due to permission errors.
                                Eventually the team got the hang of using Git and GitHub so the challenges ultimately
                                did not cause any problems for us.

                            <p> This week we didn’t face any scheduling issues but that’s only because we didn’t have
                                anything to schedule yet. Since this week was just setting GitHub up there wasn’t
                                anything we really needed to schedule and we were able to complete our tasks on time
                                without any issues. We’re still working out a timeline for our project so we could run
                                into scheduling issues later down the line if we don’t get our timeline together soon,
                                but for now everything seems to be going smoothly.

                                our ISP and we overall worked well together as a team. Since one of our members isn’t in

                                include them, but we still have communication through Discord so we can still
                                communicate with them when we need to.

                            <h3>Roles </h3>
                            <h4> Development Engineer </h4>
                            <p> The Development Engineer also known as the Software Engineer is responsible for
                                designing and developing the computer program or application. In our case the
                                Development Engineer will be responsible for planning and creating the code for our
                                website and all of the content of the website, such as the JavaScript games. They will
                                need to be good at coding in HTML and JavaScript in order to be effective at their job.
                                I think at the moment I’m not suitable for this role due to my lack of JavaScript
                                knowledge, but if I learn it then then that won’t be an issue. I think learning
                                JavaScript is the biggest hurdle with this role and I think we can overcome this by
                                getting this out of the way as soon as possible.
                            </p>
                            <h4> QA Engineer </h4>
                            <p> The Quality Assurance Engineer’s job is to monitor each phase of the software
                                development process to make sure that it meets quality standards and that the final
                                product turns out as intended. They will need to be able to test the program for bugs
                                and other issues that could be problematic to our ISP. In our project this will mostly
                                involve checking the JavaScript code, and while the HTML code will also need to be
                                checked, it won’t be nearly as time consuming. This job will require someone familiar
                                with the ins and outs of HTML and JavaScript. Just like with Development Engineer I
                                could do this role if I knew JavaScript, but at the moment I don’t. However I think I
                                could do the HTML part pretty well. Apart from the hurdle of learning JavaScript, one
                                hurdle we could face is being unable to debug the code, but this could be prevented
                                through good coding practices like whitespace and helpful comments.
                            </p>
                            <h4> Project Manager </h4>
                            <p> The Project Manager’s job is to organize, plan, and execute the project. They accomplish
                                this by doing planning, keeping up with the schedule, managing resources, and defining
                                the scope of the project. This person does not need to know all the ins and outs of the
                                code, but they need good leadership and communication skills to ensure everything runs
                                smoothly. I think I’m okay for the job since I think I do a good job at managing and
                                communicating with people, but I don’t think I’m perfect for the job since I tend to be
                                lax at times and my productivity could be a lot better. I think the biggest hurdle we
                                could face from this is simply not having a firm plan and timeline so we should make
                                sure this is established before we go too far into the project.

                            </p>
                            <h4> Product Manager </h4>
                            <p> The Product Manager’s job is to identify the customer’s needs and create a vision for
                                the final product. They work closely with all team members to make sure the development
                                of the product is lining up with the correct vision for the product. They have various
                                responsibilities like deciding what features should be prioritized, making sure the
                                user’s needs are represented, and helping manage the teams. Since the Product Manager
                                works at a conceptual level they don’t need any programming skills or lots of computer
                                know-how, only good leadership skills. I think I wouldn’t be a good fit for this since I
                                myself don’t have a clear vision for the final product and I only really have a vague
                                idea of what it should be. I think our concept being too vague is the main hurdle, but
                                as long as our Product Manager has a specific vision in mind then we should be able to
                                overcome this issue.
                            </p>
                            <h4> Release Engineer </h4>
                            <p> The Release Engineer’s job is to ensure the deployment of the source code and ensure its
                                ready for distribution. In our case that would be just getting the website online and
                                possibly creating an app if we decide to go that route. The knowledge required would be
                                more stuff about HTML and web domains, rather than actual coding knowledge. I don’t know
                                if I’d be suited for this job since at the moment I’m not sure if I possess the
                                necessary knowledge for this or not. I’m not sure what exact hurdles we’ll face with
                                this, but it will most likely just be issues with getting the website online. I don’t
                                think we can really avoid this hurdle, we'll just have to do some troubleshooting and
                                additional learning and hope for the best.

                            <p class="mt-2"> In order to determine which factors determine the runtime of various sorts,
                                bubble sorting, insertion sorting, and selection sorting algorithms were used to sort
                                various text files, and the results were timed. This was done by running time cat
                                &lt;text file&gt;.txt | swift main.swift > /dev/null, which runs main.swift, times it,
                                and sends the output to null in order to save time. This was done on a text file of the
                                entire dictionary, a text file of the dictionary reversed, and a text file of the
                                dictionary randomized. From these files, text files with fewer words were created by
                                adding | head -n &lt;# of desired lines&gt; to the cat command. Once all the text files
                                were created, the sorting algorithms were run, timed, and recorded. </p>

                            <h6 class="mt-2">Explanation</h6>
                            <p class="mt-2"> From the graphs of the data several explanations can be made. For text
                                files with the words already in order, smaller amounts of words tended to be sorted
                                faster by insertion sorting, slightly slower by bubble sorting, and much slower by
                                selection sorting. This is likely because insertion sorting and bubble sorting start by
                                checking if everything is already in order, and while selection sorting selects an index
                                then checks for a minimum, then selects the next index and checks again, making it much
                                slower for words that are already in order. For text files in reverse order while the
                                trends showed bubble sort to be the most efficent, removing the instances of the CPU
                                overtiming, it's found that insertion sort is the fastest. Selection sort is still the
                                slowest. This is because insertion sort's method of swapping is faster than bubble
                                sort's checking each pair of words one by one which takes ages since it needs to take
                                the strings at the end all the way to the start by swapping one by one. Selection sort
                                is only efficient for small quantities of words here because selection sort has to
                                constantly traverse the whole array to find the lowest value, which is quick on small
                                amounts, but on large amount of words in reverse order, having to traverse the entire
                                array to find the string with the lowest value takes ages. Lastly, for the text files in
                                random order, the trend shows that insertion sort is the fastest, bubble sort is the
                                second, and selection sort is slowest. However the trend only shows selection as the
                                slowest because it starts timing out at much lower quantities of strings than the
                                others, and when looking at the lower quantites of words before selection sort starts
                                timing out, its acutally the second fastest. Insertion is as usual the fastest due to
                                it's method of sorting being faster than bubble sort's comparing every single pair and
                                selection sort having to traverse the whole array to find the minimum. Selection sort is
                                only faster than bubble sort for smaller amounts of words because traversing the entire
                                array for a mininmum takes too long for larger amounts of words to the point where
                                checking each pair is faster. Overall insertion sort is the fastest, selection sort is
                                the second fastest for smaller amounts of words, but for larger amounts of words bubble
                                sort is faster. </p>

                            <h3 class="text-center"> Digital Fingerprints: History and Importance </h3>
                            <p class="px-lg-5"> Over the years the importance of the internet has increased and
                                increased as more purposes for
                                it are
                                continuously found. Many of these purposes involve the internet having to handle very
                                important information such
                                as bank credentials, logins to crucial systems, personal details, and other things which
                                we would want to be
                                confidential. In order to keep the internet secure HTTPS has been developed. </p>
                            <h3 class="px-lg-5"> What is HTTPS? </h3>
                            <p class="px-lg-5"> HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP which is the main protocol used to
                                have the browser and
                                website communicate.
                                It works by using an encryption protocol called Transport Layer Security (TLS) which
                                works by having the website
                                obtain a digital certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA), then the browser, which
                                has a list of the
                                trusted and reputable certificate authorities, is able to confirm the authenticity of
                                the website (Cloudflare,
                                n.d.). HTTPS serves the purpose of keeping traffic encrypted so that data coming from
                                the site or the user is
                                safe and allowing the browser to be sure it’s on the proper site and has not been
                                redirected to some fraudulent
                                site. </p>
                            <h3 class="px-lg-5"> Problems with HTTPS </h3>
                            <p class="px-lg-5"> When someone attempts to steal data from the connection between the user
                                and the website or pose
                                as the user
                                or the website, it is called a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. While HTTPS helps
                                protect against these, there
                                are still ways attackers can get around HTTPS such as through HTTPS spoofing, SSL BEAST,
                                SSL hijacking, and SSL
                                stripping (Imperva, 2019). However there is another more common security threat than
                                MITM, in fact, it happens
                                all the time and may be occurring on your computer right now, it’s called an HTTPS Proxy
                                Appliance. An HTTPS
                                Proxy Appliance is installed by any corporation, educational institution, or other
                                internet provider and is able
                                to intercept SSL connections by creating a spoofed web server certificate to impersonate
                                the site the user wants
                                to go to and then uses the fraudulent CA it installed to sign itself in. This allows the
                                proxy to monitor
                                everything the user does on the internet including everything they access and
                                credentials they put in and is
                                even able to filter unwanted material from the internet. Unfortunately, this SSL
                                interception cannot be
                                prevented, but it can be detected due to the SSL certificate’s hash (Gibson, n.d). </p>
                            <h3 class="px-lg-5"> How to Combat SSL Intercetpion </h3>
                            <p class="px-lg-5"> A hash is a mapping of data to a fixed-length output using an algorithm,
                                and if one bit of the
                                certificate is
                                changed its hash completely changes, ensuring the encryption of the hash. In order for
                                the hash to be secure, it
                                needs to be a one-way function so that no one should be able to reverse and it shouldn’t
                                have collision which is
                                when two pieces of data produce the same output (digicert, 2021). The hash is used to
                                fingerprint the digital
                                certificate, and since a fraudulent certificate will have a different fingerprint, you
                                can check to see if the
                                certificate is fraudulent by using a site such as grc.com to see what the correct
                                fingerprint should be. When
                                checking to see if a certificate is being spoofed or not, one might get some
                                false-positives where the
                                certificate might look spoofed due to having a different fingerprint, but in reality,
                                it’s because that website
                                has multiple certificates. However, one of the websites that provide legitimate
                                fingerprints could get
                                intercepted to show the fraudulent fingerprint instead resulting in false-negatives.
                                However, this can be
                                prevented by making sure the site has an EV certificate which can’t be spoofed, and if
                                it doesn’t then one can
                                just look at the fingerprints on a device that doesn’t have an HTTPS proxy and just
                                print out the fingerprints
                                for reference. </p>
                            <h3 class="px-lg-5"> Conclusion </h3>
                            <p class="px-lg-5"> While we do have ways to defend against HTTPS Proxy Appliance, it begs
                                the question of whether
                                it's okay for
                                these to be installed on your computer in the first place. Personally, I believe it
                                depends on what organization
                                is installing it. If an educational institution wants to keep tabs on its students while
                                they use school devices
                                then that’s perfectly fine since the school devices are school property in the first
                                place. On the other hand,
                                if an internet provider is doing this, then things become unethical as one should be
                                able to use the internet
                                for personal uses without having to be monitored. Things begin to go into the gray area
                                when it comes to work
                                and the government, but ultimately it depends on whether the people need to monitor the
                                user’s internet access
                                and whether it's a violation of the user’s privacy or not. Overall the security of the
                                internet is an important
                                matter, but often this security can be put at risk and it's up to us to make sure that
                                we have our privacy when
                                we need it. </p>

                            <h3 class="text-center"> Sentient AI and its Benefits </h3>
                            <p class="px-lg-5">AI has come a long way from being a convenient way to perform simple
                                tasks, to being able to perform complex tasks that would be difficult for a human to
                                even comprehend. Some believe that one day AI will even become fully sentient, but
                                whether this is a good thing remains to be debated. I believe that sentient AI is a good
                                thing and will benefit mankind. </p>
                            <h3 class="px-lg-5"> What AI has already done for us </h3>
                            <p class="px-lg-5"> To start, AI so far has already done a lot of amazing things for us. For
                                instance, OpenAI’s chatbot, GPT-3, is being used to write screenplays, compose marketing
                                emails, and develop video games. AI such as Github’s CoPilot can even write its own
                                code. But AI can go far beyond making things easier for us, it can even do things that
                                we could never achieve on our own. DeepMind’s Alphafold has made predictions for nearly
                                all 200 million proteins of the human body, producing data that allows new medicine to
                                be produced that could potentially save many lives (Roose, 2022). AI continues to evolve
                                and improve with time, and with each improvement, it can perform even more tasks that
                                can both make things easier for us and do things that we could never do, and while some
                                of these achievements may seem trivial some of them may have a greater impact on our
                                lives than we could ever imagine.
                            </p>
                            <h3 class="px-lg-5"> Where Sentient AI could take us </h3>
                            <p class="px-lg-5"> Now AI has already done so much good for us, imagine what it could do if
                                it was sentient. If AI was sentient it could understand the nature of other humans
                                better. For instance, self-driving cars with sentient AI would be able to better
                                anticipate the actions of other drivers on the road since they would now have the
                                capacity to understand human factors of driving like mood and behavior. Sentience will
                                also allow AI to have self-motivation, meaning instead of being given a problem to
                                solve, it will identify its own problems and solve them (Musser, 2017). This could allow
                                AI to be of even greater service to mankind since it will be able to solve problems we
                                didn’t even know we had. Sentient AI could also be useful for giving people therapy.
                                This is already being done with an AI called Woebot, but Woebot still has a lot of
                                limitations and while it can be therapeutic, it does not serve as actual therapy (Brown,
                                2021). However sentient AI could change this and serve as what we need to give people
                                actual therapy that goes beyond just having people confess to AI, but AI being able to
                                actually understand human problems and help humans solve them.
                            </p>
                            <h3 class="px-lg-5"> Why it won't lead to our downfall </h3>
                            <p class="px-lg-5"> Some may argue that sentient AI could lead to AI turning on us like we
                                see in Sci-Fi movies such as Terminator, but this is far from reality. There is no
                                evidence that AI becoming sentient will cause it to turn against us. AI is designed to
                                mimic the human brain in small ways, it could not get to the point where we could no
                                longer control it even if it did gain sentience (Metz, 2022).
                            </p>
                            <h3 class="px-lg-5"> Conclusion </h3>
                            <p class="px-lg-5">However, we are far from AI becoming sentient, and it is unlikely it will
                                become sentient anytime soon, and it may not even be possible for it to become sentient.
                                However in the event, it did become sentient, it would be very beneficial to mankind.
                            </p>

                            <h3 class="text-center"> Decision Making Bias in our ISP </h3>
                            <p class="px-lg-5"> During the course of our ISP we will have to make many decisions on how
                                to proceed with our project. Some of these decisions will be minor ones that don’t have
                                much of an impact, while others will be major decisions that could completely change the
                                course of our ISP. For this reason it's important that we make the right decisions, and
                                that our decisions are free of bias. There are various types of bias we could face, and
                                their impact could lead to our decision making being less fruitfull and ultimately
                                worsen the quality of our ISP. To prevent this I have created solutions to some of the
                                various types of biases we may face. Throughout this essay the types of biases will be
                                capitlized to emphasize the importance of each one. </p>
                            <h3 class="px-lg-5"> Desire Bias </h3>
                            <p class="px-lg-5"> One bias we may face during our ISP is a Desire bias. A Desire bias is
                                when “[t]he probability of desired outcomes may be assessed to be greater than actually
                                warrants”, essentially meaning that one thinks the odds of something they want happening
                                is much greater than it actually is, often due to wishful thinking or the importance of
                                the outcome to the decision maker (Arnot, 2001). We could easily face this bias when
                                trying to find things that work with our ISP, since we might come up with some ideas
                                that we really like, but in reality can’t be utilized. We could combat this by trying to
                                think as realistically as possible, through recognizing the things that we can and can’t
                                accomplish. We need to all be aware of our weaknesses, strengths, and skills we possess
                                to understand what we can and can’t do. We may also face Desire biases when trying to
                                find a solution to a problem, where we might really want to believe a certain solution
                                will work out, even though it probably won’t. In this case we need to think critically
                                about the likelihood of our code functioning, and we need to recognize when something
                                just won’t work. Desire biases can ultimately be conquered through critical thinking and
                                recognizing what we can and can’t do.
                            </p>
                            <h3 class="px-lg-5"> Escalation Bias </h3>
                            <p class="px-lg-5"> Another bias we may face is an Escalation bias, which is when one
                                increasingly commits to a decision, despite the previous decisions being known to be
                                incorrect (Arnot, 2001). We could face this bias after continuing with an idea despite
                                realizing the idea is flawed or when continuing with certain code despite their being a
                                more efficient solution. While the logical solution to this problem may just be to
                                recognize when something’s not working and backout, this could lead to another problem
                                known as the Wrecking Ball Phenomenon. This is when one realizes that they need to
                                change the path they’ve gone down, so they overcorrect and do a complete 180 to other
                                path, and the problem with this is that it while it does get rid of all the problems
                                with the existing path, it also gets rids of its benefits (Perry, n.d.). The better
                                thing to do is instead find a compromise between the path you're currently on and the
                                new path you want to take. For instance, instead of completely scrapping an idea that
                                doesn’t work, take the good aspects about that idea and use that for a new idea. Through
                                this method we can effectively prevent an Escalation bias from going too far.
                            </p>
                            <h3 class="px-lg-5"> Complexity Bias </h3>
                            <p class="px-lg-5"> We could also face a Complexity bias which is when factors such as time
                                pressure, information overload, task stress, and other factors make a task be seen as
                                more complex than it actually is (Arnot, 2001). Given the complexity of our ideas for
                                our ISP we are very likely to face this problem, as we could easily face information
                                overload from all the knowledge we need to acquire to execute our ideas, such as
                                learning Javascript, understanding how chatbots work, and the extra HTML knowledge we
                                need. When we begin to approach the deadline the time pressure will definitely start to
                                kick in and impact our decision making. In order to avoid making things seem too
                                complicated from all of these factors, we could try to plan extensively and make sure we
                                have all our ideas planned out before we execute them. Making a schedule could also help
                                with time stress. By breaking things down, the task will begin to seem less complex and
                                we will be able to make better decisions.</p>
                            <h3 class="px-lg-5"> Habit Bias </h3>
                            <p class="px-lg-5"> It’s possible we could also face Habit bias which is when we make
                                decisions based on what we’ve done before, rather than try new things (Arnot, 2001).
                                During the course of this project we will be diving into a lot of unfamiliar territory,
                                and it may seem more comfortable to stick with doing things we’ve done before, such as
                                only using coding concepts we already know. However in order for this project to be
                                successful we need to try new things and we can’t always stick with things we’ve already
                                done. In order to avoid falling into this bias we need to be open to learning and trying
                                new things, so we should try to learn new things that can help us with the code rather
                                than just sticking to stuff we already know.

                            <h3 class="px-lg-5"> Framing Bias </h3>
                            <p class="px-lg-5"> Lastly, a Framing bias is another bias we could run into which is when
                                an event being framed as a gain or loss leads to it being evaluated differently (Arnot,
                                2001). For instance, one decision we might face is whether to proceed with an idea or
                                not, and if we frame this as a loss for our project we might be more inclined to proceed
                                with it, but if we frame it as a gain for giving us more time then we might be more
                                inclined to not proceed with it. To stop Framing bias from affecting us, we will need to
                                acknowledge the pros and cons of every option so that way we can avoid falling into
                                binary thinking where everything is either a gain or a loss. This will ensure we see the
                                good and bad in all situations, giving us a broader perspective and better decision
                                making.
                            </p>
                            <h3 class="px-lg-5"> Conclusion </h3>
                            <p class="px-lg-5"> There are a lot of biases we might face during the course of this ISP
                                and some may be more serious than others. But through extensive planning, critical
                                thinking and open mindedness we can make sure we don’t fall into these biases and make
                                the best decisions possible. This will ensure a successful ISP.</p>

                            <h6>Merge Sort</h6>
                            <p class="mt-2">Merge sort is a sorting algorithm that works by splitting an array into
                                subarrays and then merges them back together while putting the elements in order.
                            </p>
                            <p>For instance in the picture the sort starts by splitting the starting array of four
                                elements into two subarrays of two elements which are then each split into a subarray of
                                one element. Then the subarrays are merged back together, while putting the elements in
                                order and eventually resulting in an array where all the elements are in order.
                            </p>
                            <img src="./assets/images/merge-sort.png" alt="merge sort flowchart" class="d-block mx-auto"
                                style="max-width: 217px">
                            <p class="mt-2">It always takes a linear amount of time since it always divides the array
                                into two halves and takes a linear time to merge them back together. This makes it good
                                for large arrays, but not so good for smaller arrays. It uses additional memory to
                                create subarrays, so it’s not optimal for low storage.
                            </p>
                            <h6>Quick Sort</h6>
                            <p>Quick sort is a sorting algorithm that works by choosing a number as its pivot,
                                and partitioning the elements so that the ones less than the pivot are on the pivot’s
                                left, and the one’s greater than the pivot are on the pivot’s right. Those partitioned
                                sides are then also partitioned over and over until every element is in the correct
                                position and the sort is complete. This is shown in the picture below.
                            </p>
                            <img src="./assets/images/quick-sort.png" alt="quick sort flowchart" class="d-block mx-auto"
                                style="max-width: 312px">
                            <p class="mt-2 text-center">The actual partitioning works by starting by comparing the pivot
                                with the first element.</p>
                            <img src="./assets/images/partition-1.png" alt="partition flowchart" class="d-block mx-auto"
                                style="max-width: 512px">
                            <p class="mt-2 text-center">If the element is greater than the pivot then a second pointer
                                (the first pointer is the pivot) is put at that element. Then it compares the pivot with
                                the next element and if it's less than the pivot its swapped with the second pointer.
                            </p>
                            <img src="./assets/images/partition-2.png" alt="partition flowchart" class="d-block mx-auto"
                                style="max-width: 512px">
                            <p class="mt-2 text-center">For instance in the picture below 8 is the second pointer, so
                                the algorithm keeps checking each element until it finds 1 which is less than the pivot
                                so it gets swapped with 8.
                            </p>
                            <img src="./assets/images/partition-3.png" alt="partition flowchart" class="d-block mx-auto"
                                style="max-width: 512px">
                            <p class="mt-2 text-center">This process repeats over and over until every element has been
                                compared with the pivot and swapped accordingly, and then the last second pointer is
                                swapped with the pivot causing all the elements less than the pointer to be on the left,
                                and all the ones greater than the pointer to be on the right.
                            </p>
                            <img src="./assets/images/partition-4.png" alt="partition flowchart" class="d-block mx-auto"
                                style="max-width: 512px">
                            <p class="mt-2">Quick sort’s time complexity varies based on how the pivot is chosen, if the
                                pivot is selected so that both sides are balanced then it's fast, but if it's positioned
                                where both sides are extremely unbalanced then it's much slower. Quick Sort doesn’t use
                                much memory since all the partitioning is done within the original array. However it's
                                an unstable sort since duplicate elements don’t maintain their relative positions.
                            </p>
                            <h6>Heap Sort</h6>
                            <p>Heap sort is a sorting algorithm where the array is first built into a binary tree. A
                                binary tree is a data structure where each node has two children. You can see an example
                                of an array being turned into a binary tree in the picture below.
                            </p>
                            <img src="./assets/images/heap-1.png" alt="heap sort flowchart" class="d-block mx-auto"
                                style="max-width: 512px">
                            <p class="mt-2">This binary tree is then “heapified” by swapping the nodes so the parent
                                node is always greater than or equal to the child.
                            </p>
                            <img src="./assets/images/heap-2.png" alt="heap sort flowchart" class="d-block mx-auto"
                                style="max-width: 512px">
                            <p class="mt-2">After this is done the sort is performed by removing the root node (the one
                                at the top) and moving it to the end of the array. The tree is then heapfied again, the
                                max node is sent to the end of the array, and this repeats until all the nodes have been
                                put in order.
                            </p>
                            <img src="./assets/images/heap-3.png" alt="heap sort flowchart" class="d-block mx-auto"
                                style="max-width: 512px">
                            <p class="mt-2">The time complexity is always the same so it is good for large data sets,
                                but not so good for small ones. Its storage use is minimal, just like Quick Sort, since
                                it only needs the original array to sort. Just like Quick Sort it is unstable so the
                                relative order of duplicate elements will not be preserved.
                            </p>
                            <h6>Sort Comparison</h6>
                            <p>All three sorts have their own advantages and disadvantages in regards to space and time
                                complexity. They are all good for large data sets, but merge and quick are not efficient
                                when it comes to small data sets. As indicated in the table below their time
                                complexities are all the same, but it is possible for Quick Sort to be the slowest if
                                the pivot is chosen poorly. Due to its sub arrays, Merge Sort is the worst for space
                                complexity, while Quick Sort and Heap Sort don’t have this drawback since everything
                                happens in the same array. However Merge Sort is the only stable sort, as both Quick
                                Sort and Heap Sort will change the relative order of duplicate elements.
                            </p>

                            <h6>The Basics of Recommendation Algorithms</h6>
                            <p class="mt-2">A recommendation algorithm is an AI algorithm that is used to suggest or
                                recommend products, services, posts, or any desired content to a consumer based on
                                information collected about the consumer. Due to their effectiveness they are utilized
                                almost everywhere on the internet from social media to shopping sites, so that these
                                sites can get the most consumer attention possible. For instance you might have Amazon
                                recommend you some items based on what you’ve been searching and looking at on Amazon.
                                On social media sites the data collection is often even more extensive leading to the
                                posts or videos being recommended on TikTok or Instagram based on the smallest behaviors
                                like what posts you liked, watch time, or location.
                            </p>

                            <h6 class="mt-2">The Feedback Loop</h6>
                            <p>One of the main ways recommendation algorithms are so effective is through feedback
                                loops. First it uses its current model to make some recommendations for the user. Then
                                the user gives feedback on those recommendations, through viewing or liking the content,
                                which the recommendation algorithm uses to improve its recommendations. The user then
                                gets better recommendations and the process repeats leading to recommendations becoming
                                even more narrow and specific to the user. This leads to the user being stuck in an echo
                                chamber where they only get content that becomes increasingly catered to them, and while
                                this may be great for streaming services or shopping sites, it can begin to become
                                problematic when used in social media.
                            </p>
                            <h6>Conspiracy Theories & Algorithmic Amplificationt</h6>
                            <p>Echo chambers can be very harmful in social media as they can limit the information one
                                receives. Due to the popularity garnered by conspiracy theories they are often
                                recommended to social media users, and when users become hooked onto the theory they get
                                more content about said theory due to the algorithm trying to find more of what that
                                user likes. This leads to users becoming stuck in a loop of receiving more and more
                                false information, as they become more engaged in sensational conspiracy theory content,
                                and more content of that nature is provided to them.

                            <h6>Platform Incentives</h6>
                            <p>Despite the harm of recommendation algorithms on the information we receive, they are
                                still widely used in practically all social media, often completely unrestricted. This
                                is because these algorithms are highly effective at keeping users engaged and producing
                                more ad revenue for the platform so content providers have no incentive to cut back on
                                usage of recommendation algorithms. The fact of the matter is that without
                                recommendation algorithms social media would be nowhere near engaging as it is, and for
                                that reason they won’t be going anywhere anytime soon.
                            </p>
                            <h6>Potential for Exploitation</h6>
                            <p>Content creators are often aware of the nature of recommendation algorithms and often use
                                certain tactics so that the algorithm favors their content. They may use provocative
                                thumbnails or titles to try to gain clicks or make content that aligns with trends. The
                                content doesn’t even need to be something that the user likes, as long as it's something
                                that gets the user attention, the user will engage with it more, leading to the
                                algorithm to produce more content that gets the user’s attention. When this content
                                contains misinformation it can lead to people becoming highly misinformed or becoming
                                strongly opinionated on controversial topics. This is why in our day and age conspiracy
                                theories have become so widespread, due to it being so easy to spread misinformation.
