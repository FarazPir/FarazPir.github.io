  <h1> Faraz Piracha's Portfolio </h1>
  <p> This is a Digital Portfolio I've created to show my past accomplishments as well as give basic info about myself. By creating this page I hope to exhibit my growth as a student to those who want to see what skills and experiences I have to offer. </p>
  <h2> Who am I? </h2>
  <div class="uncenter margin">
    <p> My name is Faraz Piracha. At the moment I am 16 years old and a Junior at Allen High School. I’ve lived here in Allen, Texas with my family for my entire life. My friends would describe me as kind and helpful and I always try my best to be helpful to people around me.
    </p>
    <p> I’m currently pursuing a computer science related career, although I am not sure which pathway I want to go down. I find computer programming to be interesting, so I’m leaning more towards that as my career. I’m currently in my second year of Computer Science at Allen High School, and I took Fundamentals of Computer Science prior to my first year, so by the end of this year I would have completed three years of computer science classes. Next year I’m planning on taking a third year of Computer Science. Other classes I’m taking at the moment include Calculus, Biology, English, U.S History, and Spanish. I’m also currently in Computer Science Club and National Honor Society.
    </p>
    <p> My hobbies mainly consist of playing video games, reading, comics, and watching TV and movies. Most of my time is usually spent at home, but I do go out with my family and sometimes friends. I’m always open to doing new things, and I do enjoy hanging out with my friends and family. I also help with duties at my mosque such as cleaning and helping manage activities.
    </p>
    <p> My aspirations are to go to a 4 year college/university and then pursue a career of my choice. In the meantime, I’m just trying to do well in all of my classes and I’m currently planning on getting a job over the summer. I hope to meet lots of new people and make new friends along the way. I always strive for success not only for myself but for those around me as well.
      </p>

  <h2> Why Make a Portfolio?</h2>
  <div class="uncenter margin">
    <p> A digital portfolio allows me to put all my skills, achievements, and relevant details in one place. This makes it convenient for anyone who needs these details for certain purposes as well as just people who are curious about who I am. Since it is digital it is easy for me to make changes to it, and all these changes will occur in real-time allowing for me to be able to constantly keep my portfolio up to date. My portfolio contains all of my relevant experince and skills, allowing anyone to know exaclty what I'm capable of and what I've done. I can send it to anyone who wants to know what I'm capable of, making it easy for employers, educators, and others to determine whether I'm qualified for their tasks or not. It not only serves as a convenience but also helps me put myself out there by making my info more widely available. It ultimately helps ensure my success in my career and other important matters. </p>
