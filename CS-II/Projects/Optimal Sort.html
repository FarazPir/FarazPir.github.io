    <h1> Sort Analysis</h1>
    <h2> Procedure</h2>
    <p class="margin"> In order to determine which factors determine the runtime of various sorts, bubble sorting, insertion sorting, and selection sorting algorithms were used to sort various text files, and the results were timed. This was done by running time cat &lt;text file&gt;.txt | swift main.swift > /dev/null, which runs main.swift, times it, and sends the output to null in order to save time. This was done on a text file of the entire dictionary, a text file of the dictionary reversed, and a text file of the dictionary randomized. From these files, text files with fewer words were created by adding | head -n &lt;# of desired lines&gt; to the cat command. Once all the text files were created, the sorting algorithms were run, timed, and recorded. </p>

    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p class="margin"> From the graphs of the data several explanations can be made. For text files with the words already in order, smaller amounts of words tended to be sorted faster by insertion sorting, slightly slower by bubble sorting, and much slower by selection sorting. This is likely because insertion sorting and bubble sorting start by checking if everything is already in order, and while selection sorting selects an index then checks for a minimum, then selects the next index and checks again, making it much slower for words that are already in order. For text files in reverse order while the trends showed bubble sort to be the most efficent, removing the instances of the CPU overtiming, it's found that insertion sort is the fastest. Selection sort is still the slowest. This is because insertion sort's method of swapping is faster than bubble sort's checking each pair of words one by one which takes ages since it needs to take the strings at the end all the way to the start by swapping one by one. Selection sort is only efficient for small quantities of words here because selection sort has to constantly traverse the whole array to find the lowest value, which is quick on small amounts, but on large amount of words in reverse order, having to traverse the entire array to find the string with the lowest value takes ages. Lastly, for the text files in random order, the trend shows that insertion sort is the fastest, bubble sort is the second, and selection sort is slowest. However the trend only shows selection as the slowest because it starts timing out at much lower quantities of strings than the others, and when looking at the lower quantites of words before selection sort starts timing out, its acutally the second fastest. Insertion is as usual the fastest due to it's method of sorting being faster than bubble sort's comparing every single pair and selection sort having to traverse the whole array to find the minimum. Selection sort is only faster than bubble sort for smaller amounts of words because traversing the entire array for a mininmum takes too long for larger amounts of words to the point where checking each pair is faster. Overall insertion sort is the fastest, selection sort is the second fastest for smaller amounts of words, but for larger amounts of words bubble sort is faster. </p>
