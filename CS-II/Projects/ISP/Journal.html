      <h3>Roles </h3>
      <h4> Development Engineer </h4>
      <p> The Development Engineer also known as the Software Engineer is responsible for designing and developing the computer program or application. In our case the Development Engineer will be responsible for planning and creating the code for our website and all of the content of the website, such as the JavaScript games. They will need to be good at coding in HTML and JavaScript in order to be effective at their job. I think at the moment I’m not suitable for this role due to my lack of JavaScript knowledge, but if I learn it then then that won’t be an issue. I think learning JavaScript is the biggest hurdle with this role and I think we can overcome this by getting this out of the way as soon as possible.
      </p>
      <h4> QA Engineer </h4>
      <p> The Quality Assurance Engineer’s job is to monitor each phase of the software development process to make sure that it meets quality standards and that the final product turns out as intended. They will need to be able to test the program for bugs and other issues that could be problematic to our ISP. In our project this will mostly involve checking the JavaScript code, and while the HTML code will also need to be checked, it won’t be nearly as time consuming. This job will require someone familiar with the ins and outs of HTML and JavaScript. Just like with Development Engineer I could do this role if I knew JavaScript, but at the moment I don’t. However I think I could do the HTML part pretty well. Apart from the hurdle of learning JavaScript, one hurdle we could face is being unable to debug the code, but this could be prevented through good coding practices like whitespace and helpful comments.	
      </p>
      <h4> Project Manager </h4>
      <p> The Project Manager’s job is to organize, plan, and execute the project. They accomplish this by doing planning, keeping up with the schedule, managing resources, and defining the scope of the project. This person does not need to know all the ins and outs of the code, but they need good leadership and communication skills to ensure everything runs smoothly. I think I’m okay for the job since I think I do a good job at managing and communicating with people, but I don’t think I’m perfect for the job since I tend to be lax at times and my productivity could be a lot better. I think the biggest hurdle we could face from this is simply not having a firm plan and timeline so we should make sure this is established before we go too far into the project.
	
      </p>
       <h4> Product Manager </h4>
      <p> The Product Manager’s job is to identify the customer’s needs and create a vision for the final product. They work closely with all team members to make sure the development of the product is lining up with the correct vision for the product. They have various responsibilities like deciding what features should be prioritized, making sure the user’s needs are represented, and helping manage the teams. Since the Product Manager works at a conceptual level they don’t need any programming skills or lots of computer know-how, only good leadership skills. I think I wouldn’t be a good fit for this since I myself don’t have a clear vision for the final product and I only really have a vague idea of what it should be. I think our concept being too vague is the main hurdle, but as long as our Product Manager has a specific vision in mind then we should be able to overcome this issue.
      </p>
       <h4> Release Engineer </h4>
      <p> The Release Engineer’s job is to ensure the deployment of the source code and ensure its ready for distribution. In our case that would be just getting the website online and possibly creating an app if we decide to go that route. The knowledge required would be more stuff about HTML and web domains, rather than actual coding knowledge. I don’t know if I’d be suited for this job since at the moment I’m not sure if I possess the necessary knowledge for this or not. I’m not sure what exact hurdles we’ll face with this, but it will most likely just be issues with getting the website online. I don’t think we can really avoid this hurdle, we'll just have to do some troubleshooting and additional learning and hope for the best.

      <h3> Technical Challenges </h3>
      <p> This week we did not face too many technical issues as we did not start the actual code yet and only worked on the setting up the GitHub Repository and Project Page. Getting the hang of using issues in GitHub took some time and there was some confusion in the beginning. There were also issues we ran into with git push due to permission errors. Eventually the team got the hang of using Git and GitHub so the challenges ultimately did not cause any problems for us.  
      </p>
      <h3> Scheduling Challenges </h3> 
      <p> This week we didn’t face any scheduling issues but that’s only because we didn’t have anything to schedule yet. Since this week was just setting GitHub up there wasn’t anything we really needed to schedule and we were able to complete our tasks on time without any issues. We’re still working out a timeline for our project so we could run into scheduling issues later down the line if we don’t get our timeline together soon, but for now everything seems to be going smoothly.
      </p>
      <h3> Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
      <p> Our team worked well together this week. We were all able to work together and help each other with setting up GitHub. We were able to have some discussion over the future of our ISP and we overall worked well together as a team. Since one of our members isn’t in the same class as the rest of the group, our in-class discussions weren’t able to include them, but we still have communication through Discord so we can still communicate with them when we need to.
