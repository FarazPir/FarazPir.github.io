      <h3> Technical Challenges </h3>
      <p> No technical challenges I was aware of, not due to not getting anything done this time, rather it was instead due to school being canceled for most of the week due to icy roads. We didn’t communicate a lot over this time so I’m unsure what problems other team members encountered.
      </p>
      <h3> Scheduling Challenges </h3> 
      <p> This break gave us a lot of time to get work done. Since we didn’t communicate too much over break I don’t know how much was done, but from the conversations I’ve had with other members it's clear some javaScript learning was done. A member also sent a message out to all members to start coding in javaScript so more of us probably got started on that. Overall due to being out the whole week I’m not sure what exactly was done, but I’m under the impression members did get work done as there was some new activity on the GitHub.

      </p>
      <h3> Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
      <p> Our group being unable to communicate in person was a huge challenge as no one knew what each other was working on at home. We were able to communicate on Discord when necessary, but a situation never arose where we needed to, aside from sending a message to get started on javaScript.
      </p>
      <h2> 23-Jan-2023 </h2>
      <h3> Technical Challenges </h3>
      <p> We still didn’t face any technical issues due to the lack of anything technical being done. Game team still hadn’t started and the chatbot team continued to chart out and plan the workings of the chatbot.
      </p>
      <h3> Scheduling Challenges </h3> 
      <p> Still suffering from the same challenges from last week, which have only been compounded by an upcoming SQL quiz we need to study for. Despite this we’re not worried at all since we’re only a couple weeks into the semester and we still have plenty of time to get started. The question is if we will start to pick up the pace soon enough, or remain not doing much. However the chatbot team didn’t suffer from as many of these problems as they had gotten some more work done.
      </p>
      <h3> Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
      <p> The team continued to work together very well and collaborate on ideas. The chatbot team and game team operated mostly independently so not everyone was fully informed of what work had already been done, but everyone knew what was necessary to their job so it didn’t matter. There was still the problem of communication with our member in another class.
      </p>
      <h2> 16-Jan-2023 </h2>
      <h3> Technical Challenges </h3>
      <p> We did not face many technical challenges this week as no technical work had really been done yet. At the moment our team is split into halves, with one half focusing more on the chatbot and the other half focusing more on the games. The chatbot half got some work done planning out the chatbot, while the game half did not start yet, mostly due to needing to focus on learning SQL and not knowing javaScript yet.
      </p>
      <h3> Scheduling Challenges </h3> 
      <p> We did face some scheduling challenges as the game half had not started any work at all, mostly because we were preoccupied with SQL stuff. I do not believe the chatbot half had these problems as they seemed to be productive with their work. The game half still needs to get started by learning javaScript, so getting started could be a challenge.
      </p>
      <h3> Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
      <p> Our group was able to collaborate well and talk about plans for the ISP in the future as well as get work done on the chatbot. We had no issues with collaboration, although one of our members was unable to fully participate in collaboration due to being in a different class. In the future we need to make sure to stay in touch with that member so they’re in the loop on what’s happening.
      </p>
      <h2> 9-Jan-2023 </h2>
      <h3> Technical Challenges </h3>
      <p> This week we did not face too many technical issues as we did not start the actual code yet and only worked on the setting up the GitHub Repository and Project Page. Getting the hang of using issues in GitHub took some time and there was some confusion in the beginning. There were also issues we ran into with git push due to permission errors. Eventually the team got the hang of using Git and GitHub so the challenges ultimately did not cause any problems for us.  
      </p>
      <h3> Scheduling Challenges </h3> 
      <p> This week we didn’t face any scheduling issues but that’s only because we didn’t have anything to schedule yet. Since this week was just setting GitHub up there wasn’t anything we really needed to schedule and we were able to complete our tasks on time without any issues. We’re still working out a timeline for our project so we could run into scheduling issues later down the line if we don’t get our timeline together soon, but for now everything seems to be going smoothly.
      </p>
      <h3> Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
      <p> Our team worked well together this week. We were all able to work together and help each other with setting up GitHub. We were able to have some discussion over the future of our ISP and we overall worked well together as a team. Since one of our members isn’t in the same class as the rest of the group, our in-class discussions weren’t able to include them, but we still have communication through Discord so we can still communicate with them when we need to.

      <h2> 2-Jan-2023 </h2>
      <h3>Roles </h3>
      <h4> Development Engineer </h4>
      <p> The Development Engineer also known as the Software Engineer is responsible for designing and developing the computer program or application. In our case the Development Engineer will be responsible for planning and creating the code for our website and all of the content of the website, such as the JavaScript games. They will need to be good at coding in HTML and JavaScript in order to be effective at their job. I think at the moment I’m not suitable for this role due to my lack of JavaScript knowledge, but if I learn it then then that won’t be an issue. I think learning JavaScript is the biggest hurdle with this role and I think we can overcome this by getting this out of the way as soon as possible.
      </p>
      <h4> QA Engineer </h4>
      <p> The Quality Assurance Engineer’s job is to monitor each phase of the software development process to make sure that it meets quality standards and that the final product turns out as intended. They will need to be able to test the program for bugs and other issues that could be problematic to our ISP. In our project this will mostly involve checking the JavaScript code, and while the HTML code will also need to be checked, it won’t be nearly as time consuming. This job will require someone familiar with the ins and outs of HTML and JavaScript. Just like with Development Engineer I could do this role if I knew JavaScript, but at the moment I don’t. However I think I could do the HTML part pretty well. Apart from the hurdle of learning JavaScript, one hurdle we could face is being unable to debug the code, but this could be prevented through good coding practices like whitespace and helpful comments.	
      </p>
      <h4> Project Manager </h4>
      <p> The Project Manager’s job is to organize, plan, and execute the project. They accomplish this by doing planning, keeping up with the schedule, managing resources, and defining the scope of the project. This person does not need to know all the ins and outs of the code, but they need good leadership and communication skills to ensure everything runs smoothly. I think I’m okay for the job since I think I do a good job at managing and communicating with people, but I don’t think I’m perfect for the job since I tend to be lax at times and my productivity could be a lot better. I think the biggest hurdle we could face from this is simply not having a firm plan and timeline so we should make sure this is established before we go too far into the project.
	
      </p>
       <h4> Product Manager </h4>
      <p> The Product Manager’s job is to identify the customer’s needs and create a vision for the final product. They work closely with all team members to make sure the development of the product is lining up with the correct vision for the product. They have various responsibilities like deciding what features should be prioritized, making sure the user’s needs are represented, and helping manage the teams. Since the Product Manager works at a conceptual level they don’t need any programming skills or lots of computer know-how, only good leadership skills. I think I wouldn’t be a good fit for this since I myself don’t have a clear vision for the final product and I only really have a vague idea of what it should be. I think our concept being too vague is the main hurdle, but as long as our Product Manager has a specific vision in mind then we should be able to overcome this issue.
      </p>
       <h4> Release Engineer </h4>
      <p> The Release Engineer’s job is to ensure the deployment of the source code and ensure its ready for distribution. In our case that would be just getting the website online and possibly creating an app if we decide to go that route. The knowledge required would be more stuff about HTML and web domains, rather than actual coding knowledge. I don’t know if I’d be suited for this job since at the moment I’m not sure if I possess the necessary knowledge for this or not. I’m not sure what exact hurdles we’ll face with this, but it will most likely just be issues with getting the website online. I don’t think we can really avoid this hurdle, we'll just have to do some troubleshooting and additional learning and hope for the best.
