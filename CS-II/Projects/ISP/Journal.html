      <h2> 10-Apr-2023 </h2>
      <h3> Technical Challenges </h3>
      <p> This week we didn’t face any challenges, everything went smoothly without any major problems. I was able to complete my word scramble game, copy it, and then push it without any issues. The rest of the team also didn’t face any major issues to my knowledge.
      </p>
      <h3> Scheduling Challenges </h3> 
      <p> Our team’s progress continued well as usual. I finished the word scramble game and development continued smoothly on everything else. I think at this point we definitely have enough features, now we’re just adding more stuff and polishing it.
      </p>
	<h3> Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
      <p> This week we made a huge breakthrough with one of our long running interpersonal challenges. I finally got in touch with our member in another class and got him to work on something meaningful to the project. I caught him up to speed with the state of the progress and explained the process of developing a game as well as sources to use to create the game. The game he is working on isn’t necessary for the project, so if he doesn’t get it done there’s no harm. I think from this point forward our collaboration will be much better, and I hope this member’s contributions can be meaningful to the project.
	</p>
       <h2> 3-Apr-2023 </h2>
      <h3> Technical Challenges </h3>
      <p> This week we didn’t face any technical challenges since at this point we knew what we were doing in JavaScript and with branch merging. We have a pretty good understanding of what we need to do and how to do it, so I think from here on we will have few technical challenges. One decision I had to make this week was to shift from working on a tangram game, to a word scramble game since I was unable to find a tutorial for the tangram game, but it was very easy to find one for the word scramble game.
	</p>
      <h3> Scheduling Challenges </h3> 
	<p> Our team continued to progress well this week, the development of the website and the games continued smoothly. I had also started to get some work done myself on making a new game. I spent the first part of the week initially trying to find an easy way to make a tangram game, before making the decision to make a word scramble game instead. I then started working on it over the weekend. I think most of the team was pretty productive this week.
      </p>
	<h3> Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
      <p> At this stage most parts of the ISP are worked on independently. Each game is developed by a different person, and other aspects such as the help-tree and the web-design are also assigned to different individuals. I think the fact that we have so much independence is great, and I think it will make the project go by a lot faster. My only worry is that forgetting to communicate things could cause some issues, but if it does I think the consequences will probably be pretty minor.
	</p>
      <h2> 27-Mar-2023 </h2>
      <h3> Technical Challenges </h3>
      <p> We didn’t face many technical issues this week. The design for our website moved along nicely and the website looks great in its current state. There were some challenges in getting things to look right on all screen sizes, but I think we will fix that later on. Overall I’d say everything went smoothly with technology.
	</p>
      <h3> Scheduling Challenges </h3> 
	<p> A lot of our team members have been making a lot of great progress lately, such as the progress we made on the design. Unfortunately I haven’t gotten too much done since I made the matching game. It’s been difficult to find time to get stuff done, but I know I need to make some progress so I don’t drag down the team. This weekend I will try to get work done on a new game, and hopefully myself and my teammates can continue to get lots of work done as the project continues.
      </p>
	<h3> Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
      <p> Our team is still having great collaboration. We were able to talk about designs for the website, and do other communications with the team. The team works mostly independently so we don’t have that much working together on things nowadays, but thanks to Discord we usually have some idea of what progress is being made. I still feel like there could be more communication since I don’t know everything that’s happening with the project a lot of the time, but that shouldn’t be an issue since we know everything that we need to know for our work to get done. However the issue of our member in another class still persists, and I’m not sure how they can be incorporated into our project in a meaningful way, and attempts at getting them to make contributions haven’t been fruitful.
	</p>
      <h2> 20-Mar-2023 </h2>
      <h3> Significant Achievements: </h3>
      <ul class="bulletPadding noIndentMargin">
	<li> <a href="https://github.com/CSAllenISD/2023-ISP-unIQue/commit/5410e8e84c5eddc83031978692ce29098575ecae" title="link to github commit" target="_blank">Copied matching game to github repository, ironed out visual bugs, and created the proper directory/url for it to be accessible </a> </li>
	</ul>
      <h3> Technical Challenges </h3>
	<p> This week while I did not do anything significant the rest of my group made a lot of progress. One of my members got a lot of the website’s design done and another member got all of our various pages linked together. We faced no challenges as everything moved smoothly.
	</p>
      <h3> Scheduling Challenges </h3> 
	<p>
	  Most of the group worked at a steady pace, but I haven’t really done anything significant since the break. I have plans to create a tangram game, and I did some research into it, but I haven’t found a good tutorial for it. I think unlike the matching game where I had tutorials, I will have to come up with most of the tangram code myself which could be very time consuming. Hopefully I can have this game and one more game done before the project is due.
      </p>
	<h3> Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
	<p>
	  The team continued to work great together and we continued to share our progress on the project. Our ability to split the project into many parts has proved to be very beneficial as we can get work done in lots of areas at the same time. I think our members will continue to work together well and that will lead to our ultimate success.
	</p>
	<h2> 13-Mar-2023 </h2>
	<h3> Significant Achievements: </h3>
	<ul class="bulletPadding noIndentMargin">
	  <li> <a href="https://github.com/CSAllenISD/2023-ISP-unIQue/issues/25" title="link to github issue" target="_blank">Learned JavaScript for matching game </a> </li>
	  <li> <a href="https://github.com/CSAllenISD/2023-ISP-unIQue/issues/43" title="link to github issue" target="_blank">Created Prototype for matching game in personal directory </a> </li>
	  </ul>
	  <h3> Technical Challenges </h3>
	  <p> This week I worked out some bugs that the matching game still had and fixed some sizing problems. Once these bugs were fixed the game prototype was in complete perfect working order. Other team members also got some progress done, such as creating a blob for the website's aesthetic, and doing research into other ways to make the website more professional. Overall we didn’t face any real technical challenges this week and everything went smoothly
	  </p>
	  <h3> Scheduling Challenges </h3> 
	  <p> I didn’t have that much urgency to get work done this week since I had just gotten a ton of work done the prior week. I think most of the team was getting the work done at a steady pace. While we didn’t face any real scheduling challenges this week I worry if we can keep up the pace in the coming weeks.
	  </p>
	  <h3> Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
	  <p> Our team continued to work great together as we discussed the stuff we did over break. We all did the jobs that were assigned to us and continued to work efficiently as a team. However, the issue of our team members in another class not being able to contribute as much still continued, and addition we couldn’t figure out a way for them to  contribute to the project. Hopefully they will be able to play a more active role in the ISP later on.
	</p>
	  <h2> 6-Mar-2023 </h2>
	  <h3> Technical Challenges </h3>
	  <p> This week a prototype of the matching game was completed. Although I had learned the basics of JavaScript, I was still largely unfamiliar with the language so understanding the code was a bit of a challenge at times. Finding good images without copyright problems took time, and then afterwards the images needed to be cropped and all brought to the same size. Since I had created my own directory for testing JavaScript code, running and testing the code was not much of a challenge. Eventually the game was completed and all bugs were fixed, but doing the whole thing in one week took more work than I expected.
	  </p>
	  <h3> Scheduling Challenges </h3> 
	<p>
	  This week was spring break and it was our group’s time to get the work done that we had not been doing the previous weeks. I’d say I accomplished everything I wanted to during this week at a reasonable pace, however if our group had gotten more work done beforehand working over the break wouldn’t be necessary. However not many members worked over the break, but it's possible some progress was made outside the github repository that I wasn’t aware of.
	  
	</p>
	<h3> Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
	  <p> Our group had no in-person meetups or calls during the break as they weren’t really necessary. We had some good communication over discord so we for the most part were able to reach out when we needed to. Since we were all working independently, we weren’t aware of what progress was being made at the moment, but it didn’t matter since we all had different portions of the project that didn’t overlap.
	  </p>
	  <h2> 27-Feb-2023 </h2>
	  <h3> Technical Challenges </h3>
      <p> This week we managed to achieve some technical accomplishments. I started to learn the basics of JavaScript and other team members made some progress on their work as well. Learning JavaScript didn’t present many challenges, although I worry that just knowing the basics won’t be enough to get through making the games. It was similar to other languages I know so I think I’ll get the hang of it quickly. Also now that we’ve got the hang of merges our collaboration on GitHub will be much better now.
	  </p>
	  <h3> Scheduling Challenges </h3> 
      <p> I’m glad that the team has started making some progress. I think as long as we don’t get lazy this progress will continue. Our team seems to also all be familiar with Discord now, so communication with the team will be a lot smoother now. I still worry that we won’t keep up the pace, but only time will tell. However, having assigned tasks should make scheduling go a lot smoother.
	</p>
	  <h3> Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
      <p> Our team continued to have great collaboration with one another. We’ve established means of communicating everything we get done in GitHub so we’re now able to have a better idea what everyone is up to. We also are able to contact our Release Engineer whenever we get commits done, so getting things merged should be easy. Overall I think we’re currently working great as a team.
	  </p>
	<h2> 20-Feb-2023 </h2>
	<h3> Technical Challenges </h3>
      <p> This week we didn’t face any technical challenges since we didn’t really do much on the ISP this week, as we were busy with our in class assignments. We had to add a license.txt file this week, but that was very simple and easy.
	  </p>
	  <h3> Scheduling Challenges </h3> 
      <p> Over the weekend we had established what roles everyone will play and what we needed to get done and how to do it, now we just needed to get the work done. While we didn’t accomplish any work yet, I think since we now know what to do we will be getting lots of work done on the ISP in the coming weeks.
	</p>
	  <h3> Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
      <p> Since we didn’t do any ISP stuff this week aside from adding the license.txt, we didn’t really do any collaborative work. I think we will be seeing more independent work from here on now that everyone’s role has been established. I think a lot of the project's success relies on each team member’s independence, but we may still need to collaborate at times.
	  </p>
	  <h2> 13-Feb-2023 </h2>
	  <h3> Technical Challenges </h3>
	  <p> We faced many technical challenges this week as we were trying to complete our first progress check. We faced challenges when it came to merges, as for a while we weren’t sure what the progress check meant by three merges, and once we figured out what it meant we didn’t know how to do it. After some research we figured it out, and then we decided to implement it by splitting up the various departments and features in different branches which would all be merged back to the main branch. Getting the merges to work properly took some time and we ran into some problems, but eventually we managed to get it to work.
	  </p>
	  <h3> Scheduling Challenges </h3> 
	  <p> While we did make a lot of progress this week, it was mostly due to the progress check compelling us to do so. Additionally since we were busy learning L-Systems, we held off the progress check all the way till Thursday, so most of us had to do all of our commits and issue interactions in the last two days of the week. We also had to figure out how merges worked so it put a lot of pressure on us in the last two days. I think this week definitely serves as a lesson to get a head start on the weekly progress checks.
      </p>
	  <h3> Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
	  <p> Our entire team worked great together this week. In the beginning of the week we successfully collaborated on the presentation and the advertisement, and our end product for both of them was great. We also managed to use Discord to keep our member in a different class in the loop, which was a great improvement from prior weeks. Despite us having to crunch most of the work at the end of the week, we were able to do a call on Discord and get everything sorted out. We continued to communicate on Discord as we got our work done and kept each other in the loop. By working together and planning things out we were able to get a lot of work done at the end of the week despite the lack of time we had, and we all were able to contribute something. So far this has been one of the best weeks for collaboration.
	  </p>
	  <h2> 6-Feb-2023 </h2>
	  <h3> Technical Challenges </h3>
	  <p> No technical challenges this week as not much work was really done by ISP this week since the main focus this week was learning about L-Systems. One thing we did get done on the ISP was a presentation on potential features, which was an issue we created a while back. I was not aware of any other work done on the ISP although it's possible some members continued learning JavaScript or did more work on planning the chatbot.
	  </p>
	<h3> Scheduling Challenges </h3> 
	  <p> We’ve somewhat begun to pick up the pace in comparison to prior weeks. Most members seem to have started learning JavaScript, and it looks like efforts are being made to knock out issues as seen with presentation, but still very little has been started on the ISP. We’re still not too far into the semester so I think we’ll eventually start to pick up the pace, but at the moment we still got ways to go.
	  </p>
	  <h3> Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
	  <p> Our team continued to work well together and we had both communication in person and through Discord. There was still the issue of our teammate in another class, but we are able to reach out to them when we need to, although that doesn’t happen much. In the future we should probably assign that member a certain task they can do on their own, so that they can contribute to the team as much as everyone else is.
	  </p>
	<h2> 30-Jan-2023 </h2>
	<h3> Technical Challenges </h3>
	  <p> No technical challenges I was aware of, not due to not getting anything done this time, rather it was instead due to school being canceled for most of the week due to icy roads. We didn’t communicate a lot over this time so I’m unsure what problems other team members encountered.
	</p>
	  <h3> Scheduling Challenges </h3> 
	  <p> This break gave us a lot of time to get work done. Since we didn’t communicate too much over break I don’t know how much was done, but from the conversations I’ve had with other members it's clear some JavaScript learning was done. A member also sent a message out to all members to start coding in JavaScript so more of us probably got started on that. Overall due to being out the whole week I’m not sure what exactly was done, but I’m under the impression members did get work done as there was some new activity on the GitHub.
	</p>
	  <h3> Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
	  <p> Our group being unable to communicate in person was a huge challenge as no one knew what each other was working on at home. We were able to communicate on Discord when necessary, but a situation never arose where we needed to, aside from sending a message to get started on JavaScript.
	  </p>
	  <h2> 23-Jan-2023 </h2>
	<h3> Technical Challenges </h3>
	  <p> We still didn’t face any technical issues due to the lack of anything technical being done. Game team still hadn’t started and the chatbot team continued to chart out and plan the workings of the chatbot.
	</p>
	  <h3> Scheduling Challenges </h3> 
	  <p> Still suffering from the same challenges from last week, which have only been compounded by an upcoming SQL quiz we need to study for. Despite this we’re not worried at all since we’re only a couple weeks into the semester and we still have plenty of time to get started. The question is if we will start to pick up the pace soon enough, or remain not doing much. However the chatbot team didn’t suffer from as many of these problems as they had gotten some more work done.
	</p>
	  <h3> Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
	  <p> The team continued to work together very well and collaborate on ideas. The chatbot team and game team operated mostly independently so not everyone was fully informed of what work had already been done, but everyone knew what was necessary to their job so it didn’t matter. There was still the problem of communication with our member in another class.
	  </p>
	<h2> 16-Jan-2023 </h2>
	<h3> Technical Challenges </h3>
	  <p> We did not face many technical challenges this week as no technical work had really been done yet. At the moment our team is split into halves, with one half focusing more on the chatbot and the other half focusing more on the games. The chatbot half got some work done planning out the chatbot, while the game half did not start yet, mostly due to needing to focus on learning SQL and not knowing JavaScript yet.
	</p>
	  <h3> Scheduling Challenges </h3> 
	  <p> We did face some scheduling challenges as the game half had not started any work at all, mostly because we were preoccupied with SQL stuff. I do not believe the chatbot half had these problems as they seemed to be productive with their work. The game half still needs to get started by learning JavaScript, so getting started could be a challenge.
	  </p>
	  <h3> Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
	  <p> Our group was able to collaborate well and talk about plans for the ISP in the future as well as get work done on the chatbot. We had no issues with collaboration, although one of our members was unable to fully participate in collaboration due to being in a different class. In the future we need to make sure to stay in touch with that member so they’re in the loop on what’s happening.
	  </p>
	<h2> 9-Jan-2023 </h2>
	<h3> Technical Challenges </h3>
	  <p> This week we did not face too many technical issues as we did not start the actual code yet and only worked on the setting up the GitHub Repository and Project Page. Getting the hang of using issues in GitHub took some time and there was some confusion in the beginning. There were also issues we ran into with git push due to permission errors. Eventually the team got the hang of using Git and GitHub so the challenges ultimately did not cause any problems for us.  
	  </p>
	<h3> Scheduling Challenges </h3> 
	  <p> This week we didn’t face any scheduling issues but that’s only because we didn’t have anything to schedule yet. Since this week was just setting GitHub up there wasn’t anything we really needed to schedule and we were able to complete our tasks on time without any issues. We’re still working out a timeline for our project so we could run into scheduling issues later down the line if we don’t get our timeline together soon, but for now everything seems to be going smoothly.
	  </p>
	<h3> Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
	  <p> Our team worked well together this week. We were all able to work together and help each other with setting up GitHub. We were able to have some discussion over the future of our ISP and we overall worked well together as a team. Since one of our members isn’t in the same class as the rest of the group, our in-class discussions weren’t able to include them, but we still have communication through Discord so we can still communicate with them when we need to.
	  </p>
	  <h2> 2-Jan-2023 </h2>
	<h3>Roles </h3>
	<h4> Development Engineer </h4>
	  <p> The Development Engineer also known as the Software Engineer is responsible for designing and developing the computer program or application. In our case the Development Engineer will be responsible for planning and creating the code for our website and all of the content of the website, such as the JavaScript games. They will need to be good at coding in HTML and JavaScript in order to be effective at their job. I think at the moment I’m not suitable for this role due to my lack of JavaScript knowledge, but if I learn it then then that won’t be an issue. I think learning JavaScript is the biggest hurdle with this role and I think we can overcome this by getting this out of the way as soon as possible.
	  </p>
	  <h4> QA Engineer </h4>
	  <p> The Quality Assurance Engineer’s job is to monitor each phase of the software development process to make sure that it meets quality standards and that the final product turns out as intended. They will need to be able to test the program for bugs and other issues that could be problematic to our ISP. In our project this will mostly involve checking the JavaScript code, and while the HTML code will also need to be checked, it won’t be nearly as time consuming. This job will require someone familiar with the ins and outs of HTML and JavaScript. Just like with Development Engineer I could do this role if I knew JavaScript, but at the moment I don’t. However I think I could do the HTML part pretty well. Apart from the hurdle of learning JavaScript, one hurdle we could face is being unable to debug the code, but this could be prevented through good coding practices like whitespace and helpful comments.	
	  </p>
	  <h4> Project Manager </h4>
	  <p> The Project Manager’s job is to organize, plan, and execute the project. They accomplish this by doing planning, keeping up with the schedule, managing resources, and defining the scope of the project. This person does not need to know all the ins and outs of the code, but they need good leadership and communication skills to ensure everything runs smoothly. I think I’m okay for the job since I think I do a good job at managing and communicating with people, but I don’t think I’m perfect for the job since I tend to be lax at times and my productivity could be a lot better. I think the biggest hurdle we could face from this is simply not having a firm plan and timeline so we should make sure this is established before we go too far into the project.
	  
	  </p>
	  <h4> Product Manager </h4>
	  <p> The Product Manager’s job is to identify the customer’s needs and create a vision for the final product. They work closely with all team members to make sure the development of the product is lining up with the correct vision for the product. They have various responsibilities like deciding what features should be prioritized, making sure the user’s needs are represented, and helping manage the teams. Since the Product Manager works at a conceptual level they don’t need any programming skills or lots of computer know-how, only good leadership skills. I think I wouldn’t be a good fit for this since I myself don’t have a clear vision for the final product and I only really have a vague idea of what it should be. I think our concept being too vague is the main hurdle, but as long as our Product Manager has a specific vision in mind then we should be able to overcome this issue.
      </p>
	  <h4> Release Engineer </h4>
	  <p> The Release Engineer’s job is to ensure the deployment of the source code and ensure its ready for distribution. In our case that would be just getting the website online and possibly creating an app if we decide to go that route. The knowledge required would be more stuff about HTML and web domains, rather than actual coding knowledge. I don’t know if I’d be suited for this job since at the moment I’m not sure if I possess the necessary knowledge for this or not. I’m not sure what exact hurdles we’ll face with this, but it will most likely just be issues with getting the website online. I don’t think we can really avoid this hurdle, we'll just have to do some troubleshooting and additional learning and hope for the best.
