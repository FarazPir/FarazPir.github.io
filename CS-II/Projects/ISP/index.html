    <h1>UnIQue</h1>
    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p> UnIQue is an interactive webpage focused on helping your brain by improving IQ, mental health, and other factors which affect your brain. This is accomplished through problem-solving/thinking games, a chatbot centered around therapeutic communication, healthy food recipes that are proven to help brain function, trivia and tips about your brain, and many other features as we come up with more ideas. The games will be browser games akin to those on websites like Cool Math Games and the chatbot will function through an AI algorithm. Our revenue will come from advertisements we run on our site, but we plan to ensure only companies that match our values will be advertised and to make sure ads don’t hamper the site’s experience. With UnIQue we hope to help keep people’s minds sharp and healthy. </p>

     <h2> Progress </h2>
    <p> We were able to complete our project over an about 5 month period of working. Some features had to be scrapped or scaled back, but in the end we were satisfied with the end product. We used a <a href=Journal.html title="link to ISP Journal">Journal</a> to keep track of our progress. </p>
