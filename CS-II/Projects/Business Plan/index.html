    <h1>Business Plan</h1>
    <h2>Identity</h2>
    <p> Our product, Foob, is an application designed to provide recipes based on what ingredients you have available. </p>
    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p> We often donâ€™t know what food we want to make and we want to know what we can already make without having to buy more ingredients.</p>
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p> Our product, Foob, is an application designed to provide recipes based on what ingredients you have available. </p>
    <h2> Target Market</h2>
    <p> Our target market is people who enjoy cooking as a hobby. </p>
    <h2> Competition </h2>
    <p> Similar applications that exist such as Supercook, Allrecipes Dinner Spinner, and BigOven. </p>
    <h2> Revenue Streams </h2>
    <p> We will get revenue by running ads on our application to generate ad revenue. We will also have the option to pay a small fee to remove ads. </p>
    <h2> Marketing Activities </h2>
	<p> We can use Google Advertisements to get ads on Youtube, websites, and other mobile apps. We can also get internet cooks to do sponsorships and promotions. Maybe TV ads later down the line, but due to the high costs most marketing will be through the internet. </p>
