    <h1>Considered Proposals</h1>
    <h2>Thefit</h2>
    <h4> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/jana-daouk/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" title="link to proposal page" target="_blank">  Proposal Page</a> </h4>
    <h4> People Involved </h4>
    <ul class="noIndentMargin">
      <li> Jana Daouk </li>
      <li> Zaenb Al Ameri </li>
    </ul>
    <h4> Overview </h4>
    <p> Thefit is an outfit generator that uses multiple factors such as body type, skin tone, trends, and modesty preferences to generate an outfit for any occasion. By doing this it saves the user the time and stress of having to choose their own outfit. I considered it because it seems like a fun and simple idea, and it effectively solves a real issue for a lot of people. Figuring out the algorithm to generate the outfit could be a challenge, but it would be very doable.
    </p>
    
    <h4> Verdict </h4>
    <p> I decided to reject this proposal because it's just too basic. There’s a lot of potential for ISPs and I feel like this app doesn’t fully utilize it. I think there are more cool ideas besides simply making an app to generate outfits, ideas that have more features and things involved. For the most part this just consists of basic coding for an app and one complicated algorithm. Overall I think there are better, more interesting proposals.

   <h2> External Clothing Filter Project</h2>
   <h4> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/reynard-gunawan/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" title="link to proposal page" target="_blank"> Proposal Page</a> </h4>
    <h4> People Involved </h4>
    <ul class="noIndentMargin">
      <li> Kevin Li </li>
      <li> Reynard Gunawan </li>
      <li> Isaac Pandyan </li>
      <li> MD Raeed </li>
    </ul>
    <h4> Overview </h4>
    <p> This idea is a filtering system designed for people to be able to purchase clothes depending on their physiological needs such as height, weight, and gender and personal preferences such as brand and budget. The idea will be hosted onto a website. I considered it for the same reasons I did Thefit as they are both very similar.
    </p>
    
    <h4> Verdict </h4>
    <p> Just like Thefit, I’ll be rejecting it for the same reasons, the idea is too simple and basic. A website with one algorithm in it doesn’t have many opportunities for learning new code. I feel like I already have most of the skills to accomplish this idea, and I feel like with other ideas I’d acquire a lot more new skills.
    </p>
    
    
   <h2>RFID IDs</h2>
   <h4> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/dylan-pettijohn/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" title="link to proposal page" target="_blank"> Proposal Page</a> </h4>
    <h4> People Involved </h4>
    <ul class="noIndentMargin">
      <li> Dylan Pettijohn </li>
      <li> Brayden Edington </li>
      <li> Sahil Patil </li>
      <li> Srisaivikas Munagala </li>
    </ul>
    <h4> Overview </h4>
    <p> This idea proposes that all students and faculty at a school have an RFID label attached to their ID, and that there will be a scanner at all the entrance doors to keep the school secure and make sure only people with their IDs come in the school. I considered this idea because I think working with RFID labels is a cool idea and I like that it can be applied to our school.
    </p>
    
    <h4> Verdict </h4>
   <p> However I’m going to have to reject this idea because I simply don’t agree with it. I don’t think RFID scanners are really necessary when the same goal can be accomplished with NFC or literally just traditional barcodes. The idea feels unnecessary and I don’t think it would be something a school would want to have. The code also would most likely be really easy, so I think I’d have to turn this one down. </p>
    
    
    <h2>The City Planner </h2>
    <h4> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/benjamin-haines/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" title="link to proposal page" target="_blank"> Proposal Page</a> </h4>
    <h4> People Involved </h4>
    <ul class="noIndentMargin">
      <li> Benjamin Haines </li>
    </ul>
    <h4> Overview </h4>
    <p> The City Planner is an interface designed to be used by city officials and residents so the officials can inform the residents about upcoming events. I considered it because I think it's a nice idea and could serve a really useful function. The code wouldn’t be too bad, but not too simple either.
    </p>
    
    <h4> Verdict </h4>
    <p> I rejected this proposal because I feel like while it's a nice idea, it's not an interesting idea. It just lacks the creativity I’m looking for in an ISP and I feel like there’s a lot more creative ideas out there. I think if this had some more unique attributes I might consider it more, but it just doesn’t do it for me as it is.
    </p>
    
   <h2>Available Tables </h2>
    <h4> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/zoe-yau/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" title="link to proposal page" target="_blank"> Proposal Page</a> </h4>
    <h4> People Involved </h4>
    <ul class="noIndentMargin">
      <li> Zoe Yau </li>
      <li> Sophia Tran </li>
      <li> Kripa Tailor </li>      
    </ul>
    <h4> Overview </h4>
    <p> This is an app which is designed to allow users to find and book available tables in any restaurant. It works by showing an overview of a restaurant’s activity and allows the user to select a table and time they want to book. I considered it because it seemed like a practical idea, and I didn’t see any difficulties with it.
    </p>
    
    <h4> Verdict </h4>
    <p> Just like the first two proposals, I’m going to reject it because it's just too basic and simple. I feel like there’s no challenge in this idea and I wouldn’t learn much new coding compared to other ideas out there. It also just doesn't seem very original and I feel like this idea probably already exists somewhere in some capacity. Overall it's a good idea, it just doesn’t have anything to grab my attention.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Ultra Light Trasnsport </h2>
    <h4> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/khoi-pham/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" title="link to proposal page" target="_blank"> Proposal Page</a> </h4>
    <h4> People Involved </h4>
    <ul class="noIndentMargin">
      <li> Khoi Pham </li>
    </ul>
    <h4> Overview </h4>
    <p> Unlike the previous ideas this idea is completely hardware based and it involves the manufacturing of light 100 watt vehicles meant to be an alternative to electric scooters and electric skateboards. It consists of a pair of electric rollerblades with custom VESC based firmware and a software differential. I considered it because the hardware component makes it more interesting than all of the other proposals on the list.
    </p>
    
    <h4> Verdict </h4>
    <p> Despite the proposal really peaking my interest with the hardware component, I ultimately had to reject it because I think it’s just too out of range for me. I feel like I really have no experience in this field, and I think I just don’t have the time to learn all the things I need to learn for this. While I think it's a really cool idea and I’d love to do something like this at some point, I think I need to stick with something I’m more familiar with.
    </p>
    
    <h2>ShelterSafe </h2>
    <h4> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/onik-hoque/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" title="link to proposal page" target="_blank"> Proposal Page</a> </h4>
    <h4> People Involved </h4>
    <ul class="noIndentMargin">
      <li> Onik Hoque </li>
      <li> Pranav Krishnan </li>
    </ul>
    <h4> Overview </h4>
    <p> This proposal is an app that helps people in the event of a natural disaster. It does this through providing info on the location and statistics on shelters, food supply, disaster updates, and all the other necessary info one would need in the event of a natural disaster. It also contains a map to help people navigate to the necessary locations. There’s two versions of the app, an administrative one for governments and organizations, and one for the general populace. I considered this one because it was definitely one of the more interesting ones compared to the other projects and it had lot of potential not only for real world purposes but also it required some learning to code, but not too much learning. </p>
    
    <h4> Verdict </h4>
    <p> This one was a close one, although I strongly considered for a while it still got rejected because the idea just didn’t resonate with me. I think it’s a great idea, but it just didn’t appeal to me. I felt like I could still find another idea that had a greater appeal to me and was still doable and involved some new learning.
    </p>
    
    <h2>The Bliss of Gee </h2>
    <h4> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/soohan-cho/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" title="link to proposal page" target="_blank"> Proposal Page</a> </h4>
    <h4> People Involved </h4>
    <ul class="noIndentMargin">
      <li> Soohan Cho </li>
      <li> William Hutchings </li>
      <li> Jacob Fesseha </li>
    </ul>
    <h4> Overview </h4>
    <p> This game is a Goose Simulator in the form of a Roblox game. It takes inspiration from other simulator games like Deer Simulator and Goat Simulator. It has lots of interesting gameplay aspects such as battles, bosses, and shooter gameplay. I considered this idea because it just looked so much fun and making a video game is something I’ve always wanted to do.
    </p>
    
    <h4> Verdict </h4>
    <p> This one got rejected for one simple reason, and that is because it's a Roblox game. I feel like making a Roblox game is something I could do outside of Computer Science if I really wanted to, and I feel like the ISP is better for an idea which isn’t so easily done outside of a school. While there is coding involved in making a Roblox game, I feel like it isn’t enough for me to learn much compared to all the other proposals.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Therapy Chatbot </h2>
    <h4> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/helen-giordano/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" title="link to proposal page" target="_blank"> Proposal Page</a> </h4>
    <h4> People Involved </h4>
    <ul class="noIndentMargin">
      <li> Helen Giordano </li>
      <li> Mehak Jay </li>
      <li> Loren Pontiff
    </ul>
    <h4> Overview </h4>
    <p> This idea is a chatbot aimed at children and teenagers designed to help them process their emotions and feelings and provide appropriate responses to help them work out certain issues they’re facing. It does this through reading from an inputted library of different conversational themes and tones, and then providing an appropriate response. I considered this idea because it seemed like it would be interesting to code, since the whole chatbot thing is something new which I think despite it being unfamiliar, is still doable. I also think it's a really good idea and could be very beneficial to society.
    </p>
    
    <h4> Verdict </h4>
    <p> I actually almost accepted this idea, but I just felt like I wanted something more. It was a good concept, but I feel like I wanted a more interesting one for my proposal. A chatbot alone just didn’t seem like that interesting of an idea. However, the plan is now to incorporate this idea into the proposal which I decided on since I realized it could easily be incorporated into it.
    </p>
    
    <h2>unIQue </h2>
    <h4> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/mason-graham/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" title="link to proposal page" target="_blank"> Proposal Page</a> </h4>
    <h4> People Involved </h4>
    <ul class="noIndentMargin">
      <li> Mason Graham </li> 
    </ul>
    <h4> Overview </h4>
    <p> This idea is an interactive experience that helps raise IQ, critical thinking skills, brain strength, and aid in mental health. It does this through engaging games, healthy lifestyle suggestions, and proven scientific proverbs. I strongly considered this one because the idea was unique and I feel like it had a lot to offer since it has so many different components. The coding process also would be interesting because while some parts would be simple, the games will be more complex and will likely require some learning of javascript or other programming languages. </p>
    
    <h4> Verdict </h4>
    <p> Ultimately, this was the proposal I decided to land on because of its concepts and its complex, but not too complicated idea. Its coding will be a decent challenge and be a fun learning experience while not being too impossible. Its concept is also one the more unique ones, so I think our final-product will be something unique compared to the other ideas. Also the chatbot from the previous proposal can be incorporated into this to help in the mental health aspect so I think overall this proposal has the most going for it. </p>
