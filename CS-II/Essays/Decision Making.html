      <h3 class="centerText"> Decision Making Bias in our ISP </h3>
      <p> During the course of our ISP we will have to make many decisions on how to proceed with our project. Some of these decisions will be minor ones that don’t have much of an impact, while others will be major decisions that could completely change the course of our ISP. For this reason it's important that we make the right decisions, and that our decisions are free of bias. There are various types of bias we could face, and their impact could lead to our decision making being less fruitfull and ultimately worsen the quality of our ISP. To prevent this I have created solutions to some of the various types of biases we may face. Throughout this essay the types of biases will be capitlized to emphasize the importance of each one.
      </p>
      <h3> Desire Bias </h3>  
      <p> One bias we may face during our ISP is a Desire bias. A Desire bias is when “[t]he probability of desired outcomes may be assessed to be greater than actually warrants”, essentially meaning that one thinks the odds of something they want happening is much greater than it actually is, often due to wishful thinking or the importance of the outcome to the decision maker (Arnot, 2001). We could easily face this bias when trying to find things that work with our ISP, since we might come up with some ideas that we really like, but in reality can’t be utilized. We could combat this by trying to think as realistically as possible, through recognizing the things that we can and can’t accomplish. We need to all be aware of our weaknesses, strengths, and skills we possess to understand what we can and can’t do. We may also face Desire biases when trying to find a solution to a problem, where we might really want to believe a certain solution will work out, even though it probably won’t. In this case we need to think critically about the likelihood of our code functioning, and we need to recognize when something just won’t work. Desire biases can ultimately be conquered through critical thinking and recognizing what we can and can’t do.
      </p>
      <h3> Escalation Bias </h3>
      <p> Another bias we may face is an Escalation bias, which is when one increasingly commits to a decision, despite the previous decisions being known to be incorrect (Arnot, 2001). We could face this bias after continuing with an idea despite realizing the idea is flawed or when continuing with certain code despite their being a more efficient solution. While the logical solution to this problem may just be to recognize when something’s not working and backout, this could lead to another problem known as the Wrecking Ball Phenomenon. This is when one realizes that they need to change the path they’ve gone down, so they overcorrect and do a complete 180 to other path, and the problem with this is that it while it does get rid of all the problems with the existing path, it also gets rids of its benefits (Perry, n.d.). The better thing to do is instead find a compromise between the path you're currently on and the new path you want to take. For instance, instead of completely scrapping an idea that doesn’t work, take the good aspects about that idea and use that for a new idea. Through this method we can effectively prevent an Escalation bias from going too far.
      </p>
      <h3> Complexity Bias </h3> 
      <p> We could also face a Complexity bias which is when factors such as time pressure, information overload, task stress, and other factors make a task be seen as more complex than it actually is (Arnot, 2001). Given the complexity of our ideas for our ISP we are very likely to face this problem, as we could easily face information overload from all the knowledge we need to acquire to execute our ideas, such as learning Javascript, understanding how chatbots work, and the extra HTML knowledge we need. When we begin to approach the deadline the time pressure will definitely start to kick in and impact our decision making. In order to avoid making things seem too complicated from all of these factors, we could try to plan extensively and make sure we have all our ideas planned out before we execute them. Making a schedule could also help with time stress. By breaking things down, the task will begin to seem less complex and we will be able to make better decisions.
      </p>
      <h3> Habit Bias</h3> 
      <p> It’s possible we could also face Habit bias which is when we make decisions based on what we’ve done before, rather than try new things (Arnot, 2001). During the course of this project we will be diving into a lot of unfamiliar territory, and it may seem more comfortable to stick with doing things we’ve done before, such as only using coding concepts we already know. However in order for this project to be successful we need to try new things and we can’t always stick with things we’ve already done. In order to avoid falling into this bias we need to be open to learning and trying new things, so we should try to learn new things that can help us with the code rather than just sticking to stuff we already know.
	</p>
      <h3> Framing Bias </h3> 
      <p> Lastly, a Framing bias is another bias we could run into which is when an event being framed as a gain or loss leads to it being evaluated differently (Arnot, 2001). For instance, one decision we might face is whether to proceed with an idea or not, and if we frame this as a loss for our project we might be more inclined to proceed with it, but if we frame it as a gain for giving us more time then we might be more inclined to not proceed with it. To stop Framing bias from affecting us, we will need to acknowledge the pros and cons of every option so that way we can avoid falling into binary thinking where everything is either a gain or a loss. This will ensure we see the good and bad in all situations, giving us a broader perspective and better decision making.
      </p>
      <h3> Conclusion </h3> 
      <p> There are a lot of biases we might face during the course of this ISP and some may be more serious than others. But through extensive planning, critical thinking and open mindedness we can make sure we don’t fall into these biases and make the best decisions possible. This will ensure a successful ISP.
