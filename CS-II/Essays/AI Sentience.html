      <h3 class="centerText"> Sentient AI and its Benefits </h3>
      <p> AI has come a long way from being a convenient way to perform simple tasks, to being able to perform complex tasks that would be difficult for a human to even comprehend. Some believe that one day AI will even become fully sentient, but whether this is a good thing remains to be debated. I believe that sentient AI is a good thing and will benefit mankind. </p>
      <h3> What AI has already done for us </h3>  
      <p> To start, AI so far has already done a lot of amazing things for us.  For instance, OpenAI’s chatbot, GPT-3, is being used to write screenplays, compose marketing emails, and develop video games.  AI such as Github’s CoPilot can even write its own code. But AI can go far beyond making things easier for us, it can even do things that we could never achieve on our own. DeepMind’s Alphafold has made predictions for nearly all 200 million proteins of the human body, producing data that allows new medicine to be produced that could potentially save many lives (Roose, 2022). AI continues to evolve and improve with time, and with each improvement, it can perform even more tasks that can both make things easier for us and do things that we could never do, and while some of these achievements may seem trivial some of them may have a greater impact on our lives than we could ever imagine.
      </p>
       <h3> Where Sentient AI could take us </h3>
      <p> Now AI has already done so much good for us, imagine what it could do if it was sentient. If AI was sentient it could understand the nature of other humans better. For instance, self-driving cars with sentient AI would be able to better anticipate the actions of other drivers on the road since they would now have the capacity to understand human factors of driving like mood and behavior. Sentience will also allow AI to have self-motivation, meaning instead of being given a problem to solve, it will identify its own problems and solve them (Musser, 2017). This could allow AI to be of even greater service to mankind since it will be able to solve problems we didn’t even know we had. Sentient AI could also be useful for giving people therapy. This is already being done with an AI called Woebot, but Woebot still has a lot of limitations and while it can be therapeutic, it does not serve as actual therapy (Brown, 2021). However sentient AI could change this and serve as what we need to give people actual therapy that goes beyond just having people confess to AI, but AI being able to actually understand human problems and help humans solve them.
      </p>
      <h3> Why it won't lead to our downfall </h3> 
      <p> Some may argue that sentient AI could lead to AI turning on us like we see in Sci-Fi movies such as Terminator, but this is far from reality. There is no evidence that AI becoming sentient will cause it to turn against us. AI is designed to mimic the human brain in small ways, it could not get to the point where we could no longer control it even if it did gain sentience (Metz, 2022).
      </p>
      <h3> Conclusion </h3> 
      <p> However, we are far from AI becoming sentient, and it is unlikely it will become sentient anytime soon, and it may not even be possible for it to become sentient. However in the event, it did become sentient, it would be very beneficial to mankind.
