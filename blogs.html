    <h1>The Problem with AISD's new technology policy </h1>
    <p> For the 2023-2024 school year AISD has announced that they will be restricting their Wi-Fi network to the devices they've distrubuted to students. While their empower program to distrbute these devices was a great idea, this new policy is not. The school distrbuted devices are all Chromebooks many of which are cheap and low-end. While these chrombooks get the job done for students that are unable to bring their own devices, these devices are usally the bare minimum for getting work done. Without personal devices every student is forced to deal with slow speeds and will be stuck with all the limitations Chromebooks offer such as not supporting all the softwhere Windows and Mac do. This heavily restricts the work that students can get done at school, forcing them to wait to go home to get a lot of their work done. </p>
