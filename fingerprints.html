    <h1 class="noIndentMargin"> Digital Fingerprints Essay</h1>
    <div class="margin">
      <p> Over the years the importance of the internet has increased and increased as more purposes for it are continuously found. Many of these purposes involve the internet having to handle very important information such as bank credentials, logins to crucial systems, personal details, and other things which we would want to be confidential. In order to keep the internet secure HTTPS has been developed. </p>
      <p> HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP which is the main protocol used to have the browser and website communicate. It works by using an encryption protocol called Transport Layer Security (TLS) which works by having the website obtain a digital certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA), then the browser, which has a list of the trusted and reputable certificate authorities, is able to confirm the authenticity of the website. HTTPS serves the purpose of keeping traffic encrypted so that data coming from the site or the user is safe and allowing the browser to be sure it’s on the proper site and has not been redirected to some fraudulent site. </p>
      <p> When someone attempts to steal data from the connection between the user and the website or pose as the user or the website, it is called a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. While HTTPS helps protect against these, there are still ways attackers can get around HTTPS such as through HTTPS spoofing, SSL BEAST, SSL hijacking, and SSL stripping. However there is another more common security threat than MITM, in fact, it happens all the time and may be occurring on your computer right now, it’s called an HTTPS Proxy Appliance. An HTTPS Proxy Appliance is installed by any corporation, educational institution, or other internet provider and is able to intercept SSL connections by creating a spoofed web server certificate to impersonate the site the user wants to go to and then uses the fraudulent CA it installed to sign itself in. This allows the proxy to monitor everything the user does on the internet including everything they access and credentials they put in and is even able to filter unwanted material from the internet. Unfortunately, this SSL interception cannot be prevented, but it can be detected due to the SSL certificate’s hash. </p>
      <p> A hash is a mapping of data to a fixed-length output using an algorithm, and if one bit of the certificate is changed its hash completely changes, ensuring the encryption of the hash. In order for the hash to be secure, it needs to be a one-way function so that no one should be able to reverse and it shouldn’t have collision which is when two pieces of data produce the same output. The hash is used to fingerprint the digital certificate, and since a fraudulent certificate will have a different fingerprint, you can check to see if the certificate is fraudulent by using a site such as grc.com to see what the correct fingerprint should be. When checking to see if a certificate is being spoofed or not, one might get some false-positives where the certificate might look spoofed due to having a different fingerprint, but in reality, it’s because that website has multiple certificates. However, one of the websites that provide legitimate fingerprints could get intercepted to show the fraudulent fingerprint instead resulting in false-negatives. However, this can be prevented by making sure the site has an EV certificate which can’t be spoofed, and if it doesn’t then one can just look at the fingerprints on a device that doesn’t have an HTTPS proxy and just print out the fingerprints for reference. </p>
      <p> While we do have ways to defend against HTTPS Proxy Appliance, it begs the question of whether it's okay for these to be installed on your computer in the first place. Personally, I believe it depends on what organization is installing it. If an educational institution wants to keep tabs on its students while they use school devices then that’s perfectly fine since the school devices are school property in the first place. On the other hand, if an internet provider is doing this, then things become unethical as one should be able to use the internet for personal uses without having to be monitored. Things begin to go into the gray area when it comes to work and the government, but ultimately it depends on whether the people need to monitor the user’s internet access and whether it's a violation of the user’s privacy or not. Overall the security of the internet is an important matter, but often this security can be put at risk and it's up to us to make sure that we have our privacy when we need it. </p>
