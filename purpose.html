  <h1> Why Make a Portfolio?</h1>
  <p class="margin"> A digital portfolio allows me to put all my skills, achievements, and relevant details in one place. This makes it convenient for anyone who needs these details for certain purposes as well as just people who are curious about who I am. Since it is digital it is easy for me to make changes to it, and all these changes will occur in real-time allowing for me to be able to constantly keep my portfolio up to date. My portfolio contains all of my relevant experince and skills, allowing anyone to know exaclty what I'm capable of and what I've done. I can send it to anyone who wants to know what I'm capable of, making it easy for employers, educators, and others to determine whether I'm qualified for their tasks or not. It not only serves as a convenience but also helps me put myself out there by making my info more widely available. It ultimately helps ensure my success in my career and other important matters. </p>
